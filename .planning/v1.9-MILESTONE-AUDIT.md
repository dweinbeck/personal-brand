## Tech Debt

### Phase 39: Bug Fixes
- **BUG-03 (External):** AI assistant knowledge base sync requires chatbot-assistant repo re-deployment. Personal-brand error handling is improved (maps 500 errors to actionable message), but root cause is external.
- **Firestore indexes:** ✅ **RESOLVED** — `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes` executed successfully on 2026-02-16. All 8 composite indexes (including research_conversations and scrape_history) are now active.

### Phases 36-40: Pre-Verifier
- These 5 phases were executed before the verifier was enabled in config. They have SUMMARY.md files confirming completion but no formal VERIFICATION.md. The integration checker confirmed all cross-phase wiring is correct.

### Total: 2 remaining items (1 resolved)
- 1 external repo dependency (BUG-03) — acknowledged, out of scope
- ~~1 deploy step (Firestore indexes)~~ — ✅ resolved 2026-02-16
- 1 process note (no VERIFICATION.md for early phases) — informational only

## Quality Gates

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Lint (268 files) | ✓ 0 errors |
| Tests (156 tests) | ✓ All passing |
| Build | ✓ Successful |
| Auth protection | ✓ All sensitive routes protected |
| API routes | ✓ 28 routes, all consumed |

## Post-Phase Changes

Quick tasks executed after main phases:
- quick-006: Moved Research + Envelopes from tools to apps section
- quick-007: Updated homepage section subtitles
- quick-008: Fixed encoding characters on Envelopes card

All properly integrated into final codebase.
