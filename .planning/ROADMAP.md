### v3.0 GSD Builder OS (Phases 1-5)

| Phase | Plans | Status | Completed |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| 1 - Testing Feedback | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-02-20 |
| 2 - Capture API & Storage Foundation | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 3 - LLM Router & Destination Handlers | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 4 - Builder Inbox Admin UI & Discord Alerts | 0/3 | Not started | - |
| 5 - GitHub Actions & iPhone Shortcuts | 0/2 | Not started | - |

**v3.0 Total: 5 phases, 13 plans (2 complete, 11 remaining)**

### Phase 1: Testing Feedback

**Goal:** Address all testing feedback items: Brand Scraper UI/download fixes, Tools page/Building Blocks link corrections
**Depends on:** Phase 0
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Brand Scraper: remove dollar pricing, fix blank assets, label colors, fix downloads
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Tools page & Building Blocks: FRD Generator links, subtitle, button labels

### Phase 2: Capture API & Storage Foundation

**Goal:** Build the two capture endpoints (dictation + screenshot) with API key auth, Cloud Storage for screenshots, and Firestore persistence. Async-first: respond to iPhone in <5s, route in background.
**Depends on:** Phase 1
**Plans:** 3 plans

Key decisions:
- API key auth via `X-API-Key` header with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (Shortcuts can't do OAuth)
- Proxy upload pattern (screenshots buffer through Next.js API route → Cloud Storage, no direct GCS upload)
- All new env vars `.optional()` in schema (don't break existing dev workflows)
- Fire-and-forget async processing (write to Firestore → return 202 → process in background)
- Firestore for capture persistence (document-oriented, matches contact/billing patterns)

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01-PLAN.md — API key auth middleware, env vars (GSD_API_KEY, FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, GITHUB_PAT, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL), Firestore capture schema, Cloud Storage setup in firebase.ts
- [ ] 02-02-PLAN.md — Dictation capture endpoint (POST /api/gsd/capture) with Zod validation, Firestore write, 202 Accepted response
- [ ] 02-03-PLAN.md — Screenshot capture endpoint (POST /api/gsd/capture/screenshot) with multipart FormData, Cloud Storage upload, next.config.ts body size limit

### Phase 3: LLM Router & Destination Handlers

**Goal:** Add Gemini 2.0 Flash-powered classification that routes captures to GitHub Issues (with @claude comments), Tasks, or Builder Inbox fallback. Confidence threshold gates routing decisions.
**Depends on:** Phase 2
**Plans:** 3 plans

Key decisions:
- `generateText` + `Output.object()` with Zod schema (AI SDK v6 pattern, not deprecated `generateObject`)
- Confidence threshold (0.7) — below threshold routes to Builder Inbox for manual triage
- `unknown` category in routing enum gives LLM an explicit escape hatch
- Separate `GITHUB_PAT` for write operations (don't reuse existing read-only token)
- Few-shot examples in routing prompt to anchor classification
- Full LLM response logged alongside capture for audit/tuning

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01-PLAN.md — LLM routing schema (Zod), classification prompt with few-shot examples, confidence-based routing logic, async processing pipeline
- [ ] 03-02-PLAN.md — GitHub destination: install @octokit/rest, issue creation, @claude comment posting, label management
- [ ] 03-03-PLAN.md — Tasks destination (direct service layer import), Builder Inbox fallback persistence, processing status machine (pending → processing → routed/failed)

### Phase 4: Builder Inbox Admin UI & Discord Alerts

**Goal:** Build the admin audit surface in Control Center and Discord notification layer. Enables manual review, re-routing, retry of captures.
**Depends on:** Phase 3
**Plans:** 3 plans

Key decisions:
- Builder Inbox at /control-center/builder-inbox (follows existing billing admin patterns)
- Client-side fetch + Firebase ID token auth (existing verifyAdmin pattern)
- Discord alerts are fire-and-forget with 429 retry-after handling
- Discord is supplementary — never blocks capture processing
- SWR for data fetching (existing pattern, no WebSockets needed for single-user)

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01-PLAN.md — Builder Inbox list page with status filters, capture detail page with routing decision/confidence display
- [ ] 04-02-PLAN.md — Re-route, retry, and convert-to-GitHub/Tasks actions from Inbox detail view
- [ ] 04-03-PLAN.md — Discord webhook utility (fire-and-forget, 429 retry, embed truncation), alerts on capture processed/routed/failed

### Phase 5: GitHub Actions & iPhone Shortcuts

**Goal:** Set up Claude Code Action workflow for automated issue implementation, and document iPhone Shortcuts configuration for end-to-end capture flow.
**Depends on:** Phase 3 (needs GitHub integration working)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Key decisions:
- Claude Code Action v1 (anthropics/claude-code-action@v1) — stable release
- Three setup steps: install GitHub App, add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret, create workflow YAML
- Two separate Shortcuts: "GSD Capture" (dictation) and "Send to GSD" (screenshot)
- Shortcuts hardcode API key + endpoint URL (acceptable for personal use)

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md — .github/workflows/claude.yml with issue_comment + issues triggers, setup verification checklist
- [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md — iPhone Shortcuts documentation: GSD Capture (dictation flow) and Send to GSD (screenshot flow), step-by-step setup
