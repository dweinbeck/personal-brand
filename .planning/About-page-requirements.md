Goal: Display an interactive "Accomplishments" list vs. a typical resume.  Each accomplishment will have the same style & format as the Projects cards.  In this case, they'll have the following components for each accomplishment:
1) Accomplishment Title
2) Accomplishment sub-title: Role and Year(s)
3) Accomplishment descriptions
4) Skills tags (e.g. Change Management, Strategy, Communications, Scrum)

Each card should open up to the accomplishment page with a larger description of the set-up, the work completed, and the results, along with the skills unlocked

5) Company / Organization name (with logo placeholder - logos to be uploaded later)

Use the same style as the Projects and Building Blocks page.  

Take a shot at populating it based on my resume at public/Dan_Weinbeck_Reesume.docx.  Include Grad School.  Focus on both development, leadership, and strategy as well as software and coding such as R, PowerBI, Tableau, Microsoft Azure, etc
