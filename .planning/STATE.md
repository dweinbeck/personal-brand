### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- v1.1: Four phases ordered by risk — branding first (zero risk), contact last (most UX complexity)
- v1.1: Analytics stubs only — no provider integration until event volume justifies it
- v1.1: Homepage featured projects stay hardcoded; /projects page uses GitHub API (separate data sources by design)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- OG image is a 1x1 placeholder — addressed in Phase 7
- Writing page ships with lorem ipsum — real content deferred to future milestone
