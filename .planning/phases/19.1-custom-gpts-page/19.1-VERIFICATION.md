# Phase 19.1: Custom GPTs Page Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** A new public page displays Custom GPTs as a responsive card grid consistent with Projects/Building Blocks styling, with card data sourced from a single editable data file
**Verified:** 2026-02-09T05:55:30Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Visiting /custom-gpts renders a page titled 'Custom GPTs' with SEO metadata | ✓ VERIFIED | `page.tsx` exports metadata with title="Custom GPTs" and description. Build shows route at `/custom-gpts` as static. |
| 2 | The page displays a responsive 2-column card grid with 4 placeholder GPT entries | ✓ VERIFIED | `page.tsx` uses `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`. Data file has 4 entries. `getCustomGpts()` called and mapped. |
| 3 | Each card links to an external placeholder URL that opens in a new tab | ✓ VERIFIED | Card component receives `href={gpt.url}`. Card.tsx detects external URLs (startsWith "http") and renders `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`. All 4 URLs contain "PLACEHOLDER" marker. |
| 4 | Card styling is visually consistent with Building Blocks TutorialCard | ✓ VERIFIED | Title: same text-lg/bold/group-hover:text-gold. Description: same mt-3/text-sm/line-clamp-3. Tags: same px-2.5/py-0.5/font-mono/text-xs/bg-rgba. CTA: same mt-5/text-sm/text-gold/group-hover pattern. Container: same max-w-5xl/px/py-16/grid pattern as building-blocks/page.tsx. |
| 5 | 'Custom GPTs' appears in the site navigation between 'Building Blocks' and 'Assistant' | ✓ VERIFIED | NavLinks.tsx baseLinks array line 15: `{ name: "Custom GPTs", href: "/custom-gpts" }` positioned after "Building Blocks" (line 14) and before "Assistant" (line 16). |
| 6 | The nav entry shows active-state styling when on the /custom-gpts route | ✓ VERIFIED | NavLinks.tsx isActive() function uses `pathname.startsWith(href)` for non-root routes (line 37). Active state applies `bg-primary text-white font-bold shadow-sm border border-gold` (line 51). |
| 7 | Build, lint, and type checks pass with no regressions | ✓ VERIFIED | `npm run build` succeeded with Custom GPTs page at `/custom-gpts` (static). `npm run lint` passed with "No fixes applied". TypeScript compiled successfully. |

**Score:** 7/7 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `src/data/custom-gpts.json` | GPT entry data (4 placeholder entries with slug, name, description, url, tags) | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (30 lines). SUBSTANTIVE: Valid JSON, 4 complete entries. Contains "PLACEHOLDER" marker 4 times (one per URL). All entries have required fields. WIRED: Imported by custom-gpts.ts. |
| `src/lib/custom-gpts.ts` | CustomGpt interface and getCustomGpts() loader function | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (13 lines). SUBSTANTIVE: Exports CustomGpt interface and getCustomGpts() function. No stubs, no TODOs. WIRED: Imported by page.tsx (line 3), used to fetch data (line 12). |
| `src/app/custom-gpts/page.tsx` | Server component page with Metadata export and card grid | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (52 lines). SUBSTANTIVE: Exports metadata and default component. Maps over gpts array, renders 4 Cards. No stubs, no console.logs. WIRED: Imports getCustomGpts (line 3), imports Card (line 2), calls getCustomGpts (line 12). |
| `src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` | Navigation with Custom GPTs entry | ✓ VERIFIED | MODIFIED (120 lines). SUBSTANTIVE: baseLinks array includes "Custom GPTs" entry at line 15. WIRED: Entry positioned correctly between Building Blocks and Assistant. isActive() function handles /custom-gpts route. |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|----|--------|---------|
| `src/app/custom-gpts/page.tsx` | `src/lib/custom-gpts.ts` | import getCustomGpts | WIRED | Line 3: `import { getCustomGpts } from "@/lib/custom-gpts"`. Function called at line 12: `const gpts = getCustomGpts()`. Result mapped to render cards (line 21). |
| `src/lib/custom-gpts.ts` | `src/data/custom-gpts.json` | JSON import | WIRED | Line 1: `import customGptsData from "@/data/custom-gpts.json"`. Data returned as CustomGpt[] in getCustomGpts() function (line 12). TypeScript cast confirms type safety. |
| `src/app/custom-gpts/page.tsx` | `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` | Card component with external href | WIRED | Line 2: Card imported. Lines 22-27: Card rendered with `variant="clickable"` and `href={gpt.url}`. Card.tsx (lines 39-49) detects external URLs and renders `<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">`. |
| `src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` | `/custom-gpts` | baseLinks array entry | WIRED | Line 15: `{ name: "Custom GPTs", href: "/custom-gpts" }` in baseLinks array. Link rendered in nav (lines 44-56 desktop, 100-113 mobile). isActive() function applies active styles (line 50). |

### Requirements Coverage

Phase 19.1 has no requirements mapped (marked "None" in ROADMAP.md). This is a new public page not part of original Control Center requirements (CC-01 through CC-07).

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected in modified files. No TODO/FIXME comments, no console.log statements, no placeholder content markers in code (only in data URLs as intended), no empty implementations.

### Human Verification Required

The following items need human testing to fully confirm goal achievement:

#### 1. Visual Consistency Check

**Test:** Open http://localhost:3000/custom-gpts and http://localhost:3000/building-blocks side-by-side. Compare card appearance, spacing, hover effects, typography.
**Expected:** Both pages should have visually identical card layouts (same shadows, border colors, hover lift animations, text sizing). The only differences should be content-specific (GPTs show all tags inline, Building Blocks show primary tag as badge).
**Why human:** Visual appearance and subjective consistency judgment cannot be verified programmatically. Grep confirms CSS classes match, but human eyes must confirm the rendered result looks cohesive.

#### 2. Responsive Behavior Verification

**Test:** Resize browser from mobile (375px) to desktop (1440px) width while on /custom-gpts page.
**Expected:** Grid should switch from 1-column (mobile) to 2-column (tablet/desktop) at the md breakpoint (768px). Cards should maintain consistent spacing and not break layout at any viewport width.
**Why human:** Media query breakpoints require visual testing across different screen sizes. Automated tools can check CSS classes but not rendering behavior.

#### 3. External Link Behavior

**Test:** Click any GPT card on /custom-gpts page.
**Expected:** Link should open in a NEW browser tab (not replace current page). URL should be the placeholder URL from custom-gpts.json (e.g., "https://chat.openai.com/g/g-PLACEHOLDER-code-review-assistant").
**Why human:** target="_blank" and rel attributes are present in code, but actual browser behavior (new tab vs. current tab) must be tested by clicking.

#### 4. Navigation Active State

**Test:** Click "Custom GPTs" in nav bar from Home page. Verify "Custom GPTs" link gets active styling (navy background, white text, gold border).
**Expected:** Only "Custom GPTs" should have active state on /custom-gpts route. When navigating away (e.g., to /projects), active state should transfer to new route.
**Why human:** Active state logic is verified in code (isActive function), but visual confirmation of styling application requires human testing.

#### 5. SEO Metadata in Browser

**Test:** Visit /custom-gpts and check browser tab title and view-source metadata tags.
**Expected:** Browser tab should show "Custom GPTs | Dan Weinbeck". View source should show `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` tags with Custom GPTs content.
**Why human:** Metadata export is verified in code, but actual rendering in browser head requires manual inspection.

## Summary

**All automated checks passed.** Phase 19.1 goal is achieved from a structural and code quality perspective:

- All 7 observable truths verified through code inspection and build output
- All 4 required artifacts exist, are substantive (not stubs), and are wired correctly
- All 4 key links verified (imports, function calls, data flow, navigation entry)
- Build, lint, and TypeScript checks pass with no regressions
- No anti-patterns detected (no TODOs, no console.logs, no placeholders in code)
- Visual consistency patterns match Building Blocks/TutorialCard styling conventions
- External link handling follows repo conventions (target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer")

**Human verification recommended** for visual appearance, responsive behavior, link clicks, active state styling, and SEO metadata rendering. These are low-risk items where code verification provides high confidence but manual testing confirms user-facing behavior.
