# Phase 19.1 Plan 01: Custom GPTs Page Summary

**Data-driven /custom-gpts route with 4 placeholder GPT cards in responsive grid, Card component integration, and nav bar entry**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-09T05:51:18Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-09T05:52:49Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Created JSON data file with 4 placeholder GPT entries (code review, data storytelling, SQL, career coaching)
- Built typed loader following established accomplishments.ts pattern
- Created /custom-gpts server component page with responsive 2-column card grid
- Added "Custom GPTs" navigation entry between "Building Blocks" and "Assistant"

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create data file and typed loader** - `aed0745` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create page component and add navigation entry** - `f47d583` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/data/custom-gpts.json` - 4 placeholder GPT entries with slug, name, description, url, tags
- `src/lib/custom-gpts.ts` - CustomGpt interface and getCustomGpts() typed loader
- `src/app/custom-gpts/page.tsx` - Server component with Metadata export, responsive card grid
- `src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` - Added "Custom GPTs" entry to baseLinks array

## Decisions Made
- Used Inter font for GPT card titles instead of Playfair Display (per plan guidance -- short GPT names work better in sans-serif)
- Displayed all tags inline without color coding (simpler than TutorialCard topic badges, appropriate for GPT categories)

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Custom GPTs page is live with placeholder data ready for real GPT URLs
- To update entries, edit src/data/custom-gpts.json (replace PLACEHOLDER URLs with real ChatGPT GPT URLs)
- Phase 19.1 is complete (single plan)
