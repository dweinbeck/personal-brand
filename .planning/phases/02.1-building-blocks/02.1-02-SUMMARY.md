# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 02.1-building-blocks plan 01
    provides: MDX pipeline with remark-gfm, rehype-pretty-code, and Tailwind typography
provides:
  - Tutorial listing page at /building-blocks with card grid
  - Tutorial detail page at /building-blocks/[slug] with prose styling
  - Filesystem-based tutorial helper (getAllTutorials)
  - First published tutorial (setting-up-a-repo)
affects: [future tutorial content additions, any page needing similar content listing patterns]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns: [filesystem-based MDX content discovery, dynamic import for MDX pages, generateStaticParams for SSG]

key-files:
  created: [src/lib/tutorials.ts, src/components/building-blocks/TutorialCard.tsx, src/app/building-blocks/page.tsx, src/app/building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx, src/content/building-blocks/setting-up-a-repo.mdx]
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Dynamic MDX import lives in [slug]/page.tsx (not extracted to lib) for Next.js static analysis compatibility"
  - "Metadata exported as const from MDX files (not YAML frontmatter) for type-safe extraction"
  - "Fallback regex metadata extraction in tutorials.ts if dynamic import fails at build time"

patterns-established:
  - "Content pattern: MDX files in src/content/{section}/ with exported metadata objects"
  - "Listing pattern: filesystem scan -> sorted array -> card grid with Link components"
  - "Detail pattern: dynamic import in [slug]/page.tsx with generateStaticParams for SSG"

# Phase 2.1 Plan 02: Tutorial Pages and First Content Summary

**Tutorial listing page with card grid, detail page with prose-styled MDX, filesystem-based content helper, and first published tutorial (setting-up-a-repo)**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-02T13:30:36Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-02T13:32:39Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 5

## Accomplishments
- Complete tutorial browsing experience: listing page with card grid and detail pages with prose typography
- Filesystem-based tutorial discovery via getAllTutorials() with sorted output and type-safe metadata
- First tutorial published: "Setting up a repo for a new project" with 7 practical steps and syntax-highlighted code
- All pages statically generated at build time (SSG)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create tutorial helper, card component, and listing page** - `61add40` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add tutorial detail page and first tutorial content** - `dcf5721` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/tutorials.ts` - TutorialMeta/Tutorial types and getAllTutorials() filesystem helper
- `src/components/building-blocks/TutorialCard.tsx` - Reusable card with title, description, tags, hover effects
- `src/app/building-blocks/page.tsx` - Listing page with responsive grid (1-col mobile, 2-col desktop)
- `src/app/building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx` - Detail page with dynamic MDX import, generateStaticParams, generateMetadata
- `src/content/building-blocks/setting-up-a-repo.mdx` - First tutorial: git init, .gitignore, README, license, first commit, push to GitHub

## Decisions Made
- Dynamic MDX import kept in [slug]/page.tsx rather than extracted to a lib helper, ensuring Next.js static analysis can trace the import for generateStaticParams
- Tutorial metadata uses exported const objects (not YAML frontmatter) for direct TypeScript type checking
- Added regex-based fallback metadata extraction in case dynamic import fails during build

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Building Blocks section is fully functional with listing and detail pages
- Phase 2.1 complete; ready to proceed to next phase
- Adding new tutorials requires only creating new .mdx files in src/content/building-blocks/
