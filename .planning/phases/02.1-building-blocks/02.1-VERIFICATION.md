**Verified:** 2026-02-02T13:45:00Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | MDX files are recognized and compiled by Next.js | ✓ VERIFIED | `next.config.ts` has `createMDX` wrapper with `pageExtensions: ["js", "jsx", "md", "mdx", "ts", "tsx"]` + all MDX packages installed in package.json |

| 4 | Visitor sees a list of tutorials with titles and descriptions at /building-blocks | ✓ VERIFIED | `page.tsx` calls `getAllTutorials()`, maps to `TutorialCard` components with title, description, tags |
| 5 | Visitor can click a tutorial card and read the full tutorial | ✓ VERIFIED | `TutorialCard` links to `/building-blocks/${tutorial.slug}`, `[slug]/page.tsx` dynamically imports MDX and renders with `<Content />` |

### Requirements Coverage

No requirements explicitly mapped to Phase 2.1 (inserted phase). Goal achievement verified directly against Success Criteria from ROADMAP.

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected.

**Scanned files:**
- `src/lib/tutorials.ts` (69 lines)
- `src/components/building-blocks/TutorialCard.tsx` (32 lines)
- `src/app/building-blocks/page.tsx` (26 lines)
- `src/app/building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx` (76 lines)
- `src/content/building-blocks/setting-up-a-repo.mdx` (105 lines)
- `mdx-components.tsx` (9 lines)
- `next.config.ts` (19 lines)
- `src/app/globals.css` (56 lines)
- `src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` (106 lines)

**Checks performed:**
- No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments
- No placeholder text or "coming soon" stubs
- No console.log-only implementations
- No empty return statements (`return null`, `return {}`, `return []`)
- All artifacts exceed minimum line counts for their type
- All exports are present and substantive

### Human Verification Required

The following items should be manually tested by a human to confirm full user experience:

#### 1. Visual Appearance and Layout

**Test:** Open `/building-blocks` in a browser at desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports
**Expected:** 
- Tutorial cards display in a responsive grid (2 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile)
- Cards have proper spacing, borders, and hover effects (shadow + lift)
- Typography is readable and properly sized
- Navigation shows "Building Blocks" with active state indicator

**Why human:** Visual design verification requires human judgment

#### 2. Tutorial Reading Experience

**Test:** Navigate to `/building-blocks/setting-up-a-repo` and read through the full tutorial
**Expected:**
- Prose typography applies proper styling to headings, paragraphs, lists
- Code blocks have syntax highlighting with github-light theme
- Content is readable and flows naturally
- Page layout has appropriate margins and line height

**Why human:** Reading experience and code highlighting quality requires human assessment

#### 3. Navigation Flow

**Test:** Click "Building Blocks" in nav -> click a tutorial card -> use back button -> click another card
**Expected:**
- Navigation feels smooth and responsive
- Active nav indicator updates correctly
- Back button works as expected
- No layout shifts or flashing

**Why human:** User flow testing requires human interaction

#### 4. Unknown Slug 404 Behavior

**Test:** Navigate to `/building-blocks/nonexistent-tutorial`
**Expected:** 
- Shows 404 page (not a crash or blank page)
- User can navigate back to site via nav or browser back

**Why human:** Error state handling best verified by human testing

## Verification Summary

**Status:** PASSED

All must-haves verified:
- All 7 observable truths verified
- All 9 required artifacts exist, are substantive (proper line counts, real implementation), and are wired (imported/used)
- All 6 key links verified (components call APIs, pages import components, config wires plugins)
- No anti-patterns detected (no TODOs, placeholders, stubs, or empty implementations)
- No gaps found

The phase goal is achieved: **Visitors can browse and read practical, step-by-step tutorials on common development tasks.**

**Evidence:**
1. Navigation includes "Building Blocks" link
2. `/building-blocks` page lists tutorials with cards (title, description, tags)
3. Tutorial cards link to individual tutorial pages
4. Tutorial detail pages dynamically import MDX content and render with prose styling
5. First tutorial is published with 7 practical steps and syntax-highlighted code blocks
6. MDX pipeline is fully configured (createMDX, remark-gfm, rehype-pretty-code)
7. Typography plugin is registered and prose classes are applied

Human verification items flagged for visual/UX confirmation, but all structural verification passes.
