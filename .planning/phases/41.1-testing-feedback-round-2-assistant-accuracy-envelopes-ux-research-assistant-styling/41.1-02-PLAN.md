<objective>
Fix two AI Assistant UX issues: (1) remove the "Press Enter to send" instruction text and placeholder from the chat input for a cleaner interface, (2) audit the knowledge base files in src/data/ for stale/incorrect information and create docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md explaining the KB pipeline.

Purpose: Clean up the chat UI per user feedback and ensure the assistant has accurate data to draw from.
Output: Updated ChatInput component and knowledge base documentation.

  <name>Task 1: Remove instruction text and placeholder from ChatInput</name>
  <files>src/components/assistant/ChatInput.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. **Remove the "Press Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line" paragraph**: Delete the entire `<p className="mt-1.5 text-[11px] text-text-tertiary">` element at the bottom of the component (lines 80-82).

2. **Remove the placeholder text from the textarea**: Change the `placeholder` attribute on the textarea from `"Ask about Dan's work, projects, or skills..."` to an empty string `""` or remove the attribute entirely. The input should appear as a completely clean text area with no hint text.

3. Keep the `aria-label="Chat message input"` for accessibility — screen readers still need it even though visual placeholder is removed.

4. Keep the send button exactly as-is.

  <done>Chat input has no "Press Enter..." text below it and no placeholder text in the input field. Just a clean text area and send button.</done>

  </files>
  <action>
**A. Audit src/data/ knowledge base files for accuracy:**

Read each file and verify against the live site structure:

1. **src/data/projects.json** — Check for stale projects, incorrect statuses, or descriptions that don't match current reality. Key fixes:
   - Ensure project statuses reflect reality (e.g., if "Chicago Bus Text-Multiplier" is still "Planning", keep it; if it's been abandoned, update accordingly).
   - Ensure descriptions match current functionality.
   - Ensure tags are accurate for current tech stacks.

2. **src/data/apps.ts** — Verify app listings match what's actually accessible. Check hrefs point to correct routes.

3. **src/data/tools.ts** — Verify tool listings match what's on the Tools page.

4. **src/data/custom-gpts.json** — Verify GPT listings are current and links work.

5. **src/data/accomplishments.json** — Verify accomplishments are current.

Note: The AI assistant uses a SEPARATE FastAPI backend (chatbot-assistant repo) that has its OWN knowledge base. The src/data/ files here feed the site's UI components (project cards, app listings, etc.), not the assistant directly. However, stale data in these files means the site displays incorrect info that contradicts what the assistant might say. Fix any stale data found.

**B. Create docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md:**

Create a documentation file explaining the KB architecture:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base Architecture

## Overview
The AI assistant (Dan's AI) uses a two-layer knowledge system...

## Layer 1: FastAPI Backend (chatbot-assistant repo)
- The assistant's responses come from a separate FastAPI service
- Env var: CHATBOT_API_URL points to this service
- The backend uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with indexed content
- Updating the KB requires updating the chatbot-assistant repo and redeploying

## Layer 2: Site Data Files (this repo)
- src/data/projects.json — Project listings shown on /projects and home page
- src/data/apps.ts — App listings shown on /apps and home page
- src/data/tools.ts — Tool listings shown on /tools
- src/data/custom-gpts.json — Custom GPT listings (legacy, now shown on /tools)
- src/data/accomplishments.json — Professional accomplishments

## How Updates Work
1. Site data: Edit files in src/data/, commit, deploy
2. Assistant KB: Update chatbot-assistant repo, redeploy that service
3. Both should be updated together when major features ship

## When to Update
- After adding a new app or tool
- After changing project statuses
- After significant feature launches
- After removing or renaming features
```

Flesh this out with actual details from the codebase. Include the full pipeline: user question -> ChatInterface -> /api/assistant/chat -> askFastApi() -> FastAPI backend -> RAG response -> streamed back to UI.
  </action>
  <verify>npm run lint && npm run build</verify>
  <done>Knowledge base files contain only accurate data. docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md explains the full KB pipeline clearly enough for Dan to maintain it independently.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run lint` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run build` succeeds
3. ChatInput has no instruction text and no placeholder
4. docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md exists and explains the KB pipeline
5. src/data/ files contain accurate, current information
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Chat input is completely clean — no "Press Enter" text, no placeholder
- Knowledge base data files are audited and accurate
- docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md explains the full KB architecture and update process
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/41.1-testing-feedback-round-2-assistant-accuracy-envelopes-ux-research-assistant-styling/41.1-02-SUMMARY.md`
