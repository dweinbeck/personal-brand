# Phase 41.1 Plan 02: Chat Input Cleanup and Knowledge Base Audit Summary

**Clean chat input with no placeholder/instruction text, corrected project statuses for Envelopes and Research, and comprehensive KB architecture documentation**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-18T02:16:35Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-18T02:25:29Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Removed "Press Enter to send" instruction text and placeholder from chat input for a cleaner interface
- Fixed stale project data: Envelopes (now Live, correct tags) and Research (now Live, correct tags/description)
- Created docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md documenting the full two-layer KB architecture, request pipeline, update procedures, and maintenance checklist

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Remove instruction text and placeholder from ChatInput** - `87b608d` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Audit knowledge base and create KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md documentation** - `bded921` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/assistant/ChatInput.tsx` - Removed placeholder text and "Press Enter" instruction paragraph
- `src/data/projects.json` - Fixed Envelopes status (Live) and tags (Next.js/Firebase/Tailwind); fixed Research status (Live) and tags
- `docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md` - New file documenting KB architecture, request pipeline, update procedures, and maintenance checklist

## Decisions Made
- Updated Envelopes project status from "In Development" to "Live" with correct tags (Next.js, Firebase, Tailwind CSS instead of React Native) since the app is fully deployed at /envelopes
- Updated Research project status from "In Development" to "Live" with correct tags (Next.js, Vercel AI SDK instead of Python) since it is accessible at /tools/research-assistant
- Left custom-gpts.json unchanged despite being unused -- it is legacy data that does not cause harm and may serve as reference

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed stale Envelopes project status and tags**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Knowledge base audit)
- **Issue:** projects.json listed Envelopes as "In Development" with "React Native" tag, but the app is live as a Next.js web app at /envelopes
- **Fix:** Updated status to "Live", tags to ["Next.js", "Firebase", "Tailwind CSS"], updated description to mention fund transfers, analytics, and weekly rollovers
- **Files modified:** src/data/projects.json
- **Verification:** Lint passes, data matches actual app functionality
- **Committed in:** bded921 (Task 2 commit)

**2. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed stale Research project status and tags**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Knowledge base audit)
- **Issue:** projects.json listed Research as "In Development" with "Python" tag, but it is live at /tools/research-assistant built with Next.js and Vercel AI SDK
- **Fix:** Updated status to "Live", tags to ["Next.js", "Vercel AI SDK", "AI"], updated description
- **Files modified:** src/data/projects.json
- **Verification:** Lint passes, data matches actual app functionality
- **Committed in:** bded921 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 2 auto-fixed (2 bugs - stale data)
**Impact on plan:** Both fixes were required by the audit task itself. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
- Pre-existing Turbopack build failure (ENOENT for _buildManifest.js temp file) prevented `npm run build` verification. Confirmed pre-existing by testing with stashed changes. TypeScript type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) used as alternative verification -- no errors in modified files. Build failure logged as out-of-scope.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Chat input is clean and ready for user testing
- Knowledge base data is audited and accurate
- docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md provides a reference for future KB maintenance
- Pre-existing build issue with Turbopack should be investigated separately

## Self-Check: PASSED

All created files verified to exist. All commit hashes verified in git log.
