<objective>
Rebuild the Home page to showcase published apps in a responsive grid and add a Building Blocks CTA section, replacing the old FeaturedProjects and FeaturedBuildingBlocks sections.

Purpose: The home page becomes the primary showcase for apps (the site's main content now that Projects is removed), with a clean CTA directing visitors to Building Blocks tutorials.
Output: Two new components (AppsGrid, BuildingBlocksCta), updated page.tsx, reduced hero tag spacing, and deletion of old project-related home components.

  <name>Task 1: Create AppsGrid and BuildingBlocksCta components</name>
  <files>
    src/components/home/AppsGrid.tsx (CREATE)
    src/components/home/BuildingBlocksCta.tsx (CREATE)
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create `src/components/home/AppsGrid.tsx` as a **server component** (no "use client"):
       - Import `getApps` from `@/data/apps` and `Button` from `@/components/ui/Button`.
       - The component calls `getApps()` to get the app listings.
       - Renders a `<section>` with `py-12` (or similar spacing matching the existing home page rhythm).
       - Section title: `<h2>` with text "Explore my Published Apps" using classes similar to FeaturedBuildingBlocks: `text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-text-primary text-center`.
       - Subtitle: `<p>` with text "And sign up or sign in to use them" centered below the title, styled with `text-text-secondary text-center mt-2 mb-10`.
       - Grid: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`.
       - Each card is rendered inline (NOT using the existing AppCard component from /apps -- the home page cards need different button styling). Each card should be a `<div>` with:
         - `flex flex-col h-full` for uniform height
         - `rounded-2xl border border-border bg-surface p-8 shadow-[var(--shadow-card)]` (matching existing AppCard styling)
         - Topic badge: same `getTagColor` logic as AppCard (define locally or extract)
         - Title (`<h3>`), subtitle, description (line-clamp-3 with `flex-1` to push button to bottom)
         - Tech stack tags
         - Dates (launched, updated)
         - **Button pinned to bottom**: Use `<div className="mt-auto pt-5">` wrapping a `<Button variant="primary" href={app.href} className="w-full">Enter App</Button>`. The `mt-auto` on the wrapper plus `flex-1` on the description area ensures the button is always pinned to the bottom regardless of content height. For unavailable apps, show `<Button variant="primary" disabled className="w-full">Coming Soon</Button>`.
       - The `variant="primary"` on Button already provides blue fill + gold border (`bg-gradient-to-b from-primary to-primary-hover text-white border border-gold/40`). Adding `className="w-full"` makes it full-width within card padding. This satisfies HOME-04.

    2. Create `src/components/home/BuildingBlocksCta.tsx` as a **server component**:
       - Import `getAllTutorials` from `@/lib/tutorials`, `TutorialCard` from `@/components/building-blocks/TutorialCard`, and `Button` from `@/components/ui/Button`.
       - This is an `async` component that calls `await getAllTutorials()`.
       - Renders a `<section>` with `py-12`.
       - Title: `<h2>` with text "Want to learn about AI Agent Development?" centered, using the same heading style as AppsGrid.
       - Subtitle: `<p>` centered, text "Start with the building blocks below", styled with `text-text-secondary text-center mt-2 mb-10`.
       - Below the subtitle, render the tutorial cards in the same `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6` grid using `TutorialCard` (reusing the existing component).
       - Below the grid, a centered "See all tutorials" button: `<Button variant="secondary" size="sm" href="/building-blocks">See all tutorials</Button>`.
       - This effectively replaces FeaturedBuildingBlocks with the new title/subtitle copy while keeping the tutorial card grid.

    Confirm both files exist at the expected paths.

  <done>
    AppsGrid.tsx renders a responsive 3-wide grid with app cards that have blue+gold full-width "Enter App" buttons pinned to the bottom. BuildingBlocksCta.tsx renders the CTA title/subtitle above the existing tutorial cards grid.

  <name>Task 2: Update Home page and reduce hero tag spacing</name>
  <files>
    src/app/page.tsx
    src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx
    src/components/home/FeaturedProjects.tsx (DELETE)
    src/components/home/ProjectCard.tsx (DELETE)
  </files>
  <action>
    1. In `src/app/page.tsx`:
       - Remove imports for `FeaturedProjects` and `FeaturedBuildingBlocks`.
       - Add imports for `AppsGrid` from `@/components/home/AppsGrid` and `BuildingBlocksCta` from `@/components/home/BuildingBlocksCta`.
       - In the JSX, replace `<FeaturedProjects />` with `<AppsGrid />`.
       - Replace `<FeaturedBuildingBlocks />` with `<BuildingBlocksCta />`.
       - Keep everything else (metadata, JSON-LD, HeroSection, wrapper div).

    2. In `src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx`:
       - Reduce the tag spacing by ~50% (HOME-05). The current tags use `px-4 py-1.5` (line 38).
       - Change to `px-3 py-0.5` (approximately 50% reduction in padding).
       - The `gap-2` on the flex container (line 34) can optionally be reduced to `gap-1.5`.

    3. Delete the old project-related home components:
       - `src/components/home/FeaturedProjects.tsx`
       - `src/components/home/ProjectCard.tsx`
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` -- must succeed with zero errors.
    Run `npm run lint` -- must pass.
    Run `npm run test` -- must pass.
    Grep for "FeaturedProjects" in src/ -- should find zero hits.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Home page renders HeroSection, then AppsGrid, then BuildingBlocksCta. Hero tags have reduced spacing (~50% less padding). FeaturedProjects.tsx and ProjectCard.tsx are deleted. Build, lint, and tests pass.
  </done>
</task>
