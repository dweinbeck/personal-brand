Purpose: Completes the home page by showing proof of Dan's work (project cards) and hinting at future content (blog teaser). Visitors get a full picture of who Dan is and what he builds.
Output: Complete home page at localhost:3000 with hero, 6 project cards in responsive grid, and blog teaser section.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: ProjectCard and FeaturedProjects components</name>
  <files>src/components/home/ProjectCard.tsx, src/components/home/FeaturedProjects.tsx</files>
  <action>
  **src/components/home/ProjectCard.tsx** -- Server component (no "use client"). Renders a single project card as an external link.

  Props: `{ project: Project }` (import `Project` from `@/types/project`).

  Structure:
  - Outer element: `<a>` tag with `href={project.url}`, `target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
  - Classes: `block rounded-lg border border-gray-200 p-6 transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-md hover:border-gray-300 motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-0.5`
  - Inside:
    - `<h3>` with `font-semibold text-gray-900`: `{project.name}`
    - `<p>` with `mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 line-clamp-2`: `{project.description}`
    - Bottom row: `mt-4 flex items-center gap-3 text-xs text-gray-500`
      - If `project.language` is not null: render a colored dot (`<span className="h-3 w-3 rounded-full bg-blue-500" />`) and language name
      - If `project.topics.length > 0`: render first 3 topics as small badges (`px-2 py-0.5 bg-gray-100 text-gray-600 rounded-full text-xs`)

  **src/components/home/FeaturedProjects.tsx** -- Server component. Contains placeholder data and renders the grid.

  Structure:
  - Import `ProjectCard` and `Project` type
  - Import `Link` from `next/link` for "See all projects" link
  - Define `FEATURED_PROJECTS: Project[]` constant with 6 placeholder projects:
    1. `{ name: "personal-brand", description: "Personal website built with Next.js 16, React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4", language: "TypeScript", stars: 0, url: "https://github.com/dweinbeck/personal-brand", topics: ["nextjs", "typescript", "tailwind"] }`
    2. `{ name: "ai-agent-framework", description: "Lightweight framework for building practical AI agents with tool use and memory", language: "Python", stars: 12, url: "https://github.com/dweinbeck", topics: ["ai", "agents", "python"] }`

    4. `{ name: "experiment-tracker", description: "A/B testing and experimentation platform for tracking metrics and outcomes", language: "TypeScript", stars: 5, url: "https://github.com/dweinbeck", topics: ["experimentation", "analytics", "react"] }`
    5. `{ name: "ux-analytics-dashboard", description: "Real-time UX analytics dashboard with heatmaps and session replay", language: "TypeScript", stars: 3, url: "https://github.com/dweinbeck", topics: ["ux", "analytics", "dashboard"] }`
    6. `{ name: "automation-scripts", description: "Collection of automation scripts for development workflow optimization", language: "Python", stars: 2, url: "https://github.com/dweinbeck", topics: ["automation", "scripts", "devtools"] }`

  - Render:
    - `<section className="py-16 border-t border-gray-200 motion-safe:animate-fade-in-up">`
    - `<h2>` with `text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-8`: "Featured Projects"
    - Grid: `<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6">`
    - Map over `FEATURED_PROJECTS` rendering `<ProjectCard key={project.name} project={project} />`
    - After grid: `<div className="mt-8 text-center">` with a Link to `/projects`: "See all projects →" styled as `text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-medium transition-colors`

  NOTE: This placeholder data will be replaced in Phase 3 when the GitHub API is wired up. The Project type interface is designed to match the GitHub API response shape.

  <files>src/components/home/BlogTeaser.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
  **src/components/home/BlogTeaser.tsx** -- Server component. Teaser for the Writing section.

  Structure:
  - Import `Link` from `next/link`
  - `<section className="py-16 border-t border-gray-200 motion-safe:animate-fade-in-up">`
  - `<h2>` with `text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4`: "Writing"
  - `<p>` with `text-gray-600 mb-6 max-w-lg`: "Coming soon -- thoughts on AI development, data science, experimentation, and building things that ship."
  - Two links in a flex row (`flex gap-4`):
    1. Link to `/writing`: "Go to Writing" styled as primary text link: `text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-medium transition-colors`
    2. Link to `/assistant`: "Ask Dan" styled as secondary text link: `text-gray-600 hover:text-gray-900 font-medium transition-colors`

  **src/app/page.tsx** -- Update to compose all three sections:

  ```typescript
  import { HeroSection } from "@/components/home/HeroSection";
  import { FeaturedProjects } from "@/components/home/FeaturedProjects";
  import { BlogTeaser } from "@/components/home/BlogTeaser";

  export default function HomePage() {
    return (
      <div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
        <HeroSection />
        <FeaturedProjects />
        <BlogTeaser />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Keep the container pattern consistent. The sections handle their own vertical spacing with py-16 and border-t separators.

     - Name "Dan Weinbeck" is prominent
     - Tagline and bio text readable
     - 4 CTA buttons visible (View Projects, Contact, GitHub icon, LinkedIn icon)

  5. Click GitHub icon -- should open https://github.com/dweinbeck in new tab
  6. Click LinkedIn icon -- should open https://www.linkedin.com/in/dw789/ in new tab
  7. Scroll down to Featured Projects:
     - 6 project cards visible
     - Hover over a card -- should lift slightly with shadow
     - Cards show project name, description, language dot, and topic badges
     - "See all projects" link at bottom
  8. Scroll to Blog Teaser:
     - "Writing" heading with coming-soon text
     - "Go to Writing" and "Ask Dan" links visible
  9. Resize browser to mobile width:
     - Hero stacks vertically (headshot above text)
     - Project grid becomes single column
     - All text remains readable
  10. Reload page -- fade-in animations should play smoothly
