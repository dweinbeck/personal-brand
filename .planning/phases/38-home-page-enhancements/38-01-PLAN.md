<objective>
Improve the hero section layout, add technology stack tags to app cards, and update section subtitles on the home page.

Purpose: Make the home page communicate Dan's work more effectively with better visual hierarchy, richer metadata on app cards, and accurate section labels.
Output: Updated HeroSection, AppCard with tech tags, corrected section subtitles.

    **HeroSection.tsx changes:**

    Restructure the flex layout so the image column is narrower and the text column is wider. The current layout uses a simple `flex-col md:flex-row items-center` with no explicit column sizing.

    1. Change the outer flex container from `items-center` to `items-start` so the image aligns to the TOP of the text (not vertically centered).

    2. Give the text column explicit width dominance. Add `md:flex-1` to the text div and keep `flex-shrink-0` on the image div. The image is already 256px fixed width, so the text column will naturally take remaining space.

    3. Restructure the second paragraph (the one starting "This site is designed to showcase...") so it flows BELOW the image, spanning full width. Move it outside the flex row. One approach: keep the first paragraph + social links inside the flex text column, then place the second paragraph after the closing `</div>` of the flex row, with `mt-6 max-w-3xl text-text-secondary leading-relaxed` classes so it spans the full content width below.

    The result: On desktop, image left + text right (image top-aligned to heading), then second paragraph spans full width below the two-column area.

    **AppsGrid.tsx changes:**

    Change the subtitle paragraph from:
    `"And sign up or sign in to use them"`
    to:
    `"Web-based tools built for real-world use"`

    **BuildingBlocksCta.tsx changes:**

    Change the subtitle paragraph from:
    `"Start with the building blocks below"`
    to:
    `"Learn about AI Development with Building Block Tutorials"`
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run build` to confirm no TypeScript or build errors. Visually inspect the layout changes are syntactically correct by reviewing the JSX structure.
  </verify>
  <done>
    Hero image aligns to top of heading on desktop. Second hero paragraph spans full width below the image+text row. AppsGrid subtitle says "Web-based tools built for real-world use". BuildingBlocksCta subtitle says "Learn about AI Development with Building Block Tutorials".

    src/data/apps.ts
    src/components/apps/AppCard.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **src/data/apps.ts changes:**

    1. Add `techStack: string[]` to the `AppListing` interface.

    2. Populate techStack for each app:
       - brand-scraper: `["Next.js", "Firebase", "Playwright", "AI SDK"]`
       - tasks: `["Next.js", "PostgreSQL", "Tailwind CSS"]`

    **src/components/apps/AppCard.tsx changes:**

    1. After the description paragraph and before the `mt-auto pt-5` button div, add a tech stack tags section. Use the same subtle tag styling pattern already used for additional tags in TutorialCard.tsx:

    ```tsx
    {app.techStack.length > 0 && (
      <div className="mt-4 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
        {app.techStack.map((tech) => (
          <span
            key={tech}
            className="px-2.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-text-tertiary bg-[rgba(27,42,74,0.04)] rounded-full"
          >
            {tech}
          </span>
        ))}
      </div>
    )}
    ```

    This reuses the exact styling from TutorialCard's additional tags for visual consistency.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run `npm run lint && npm run build` to confirm no errors. Check that the AppListing type includes techStack and both app entries have populated arrays.
  </verify>
  <done>
    AppCard renders tech stack tags below the description. Both brand-scraper and tasks apps show their technology badges. The tags appear on both the home page AppsGrid and the /apps listing page since they share the same AppCard component.
  </done>
</task>

- `npm run lint` passes with zero errors
- `npm run build` succeeds
- HeroSection renders image top-aligned with wider text column
- Second hero paragraph flows below the image area
- AppCard shows tech stack tags for both apps
- AppsGrid subtitle updated, BuildingBlocksCta subtitle updated
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Hero image aligns to top of "Dan Weinbeck" heading (items-start, not items-center)
2. Second hero paragraph spans full width below the flex row
3. App cards show tech tags (Next.js, Firebase, etc.) on home and /apps pages
4. Apps section subtitle no longer mentions "sign up or sign in"
5. Building Blocks subtitle reads "Learn about AI Development with Building Block Tutorials"
6. Build and lint pass cleanly
</success_criteria>
