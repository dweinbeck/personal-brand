<objective>
Reorder the navbar links to match the required hierarchy and remove the brand scraper from Control Center.

Purpose: NAV-03 establishes a clear link order prioritizing Apps and Tools. NAV-04 eliminates the duplicate brand scraper access path in Control Center since it is accessible via /apps.
Output: Updated navbar with correct link order, Control Center without brand scraper link/page
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Reorder navbar links and add Tools</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx</files>
  <action>
Edit `src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx`:

1. Update the `baseLinks` array to this exact order:
```ts
const baseLinks = [
  { name: "Home", href: "/" },
  { name: "Apps", href: "/apps" },
  { name: "Tools", href: "/tools" },
  { name: "Building Blocks", href: "/building-blocks" },
  { name: "Contact", href: "/contact" },
];
```

Key changes from current:
- Remove "About" (dropped from navbar per new order)
- Remove "Custom GPTs" (replaced by "Tools")
- Remove "Assistant" (will become "Ask My Assistant" — but per requirement NAV-03, "Ask My Assistant" appears in the navbar. For now, rename the Assistant link to "Ask My Assistant" and keep it pointing to /assistant. Phase 37 will convert this to a popup trigger.)
- Reorder: Home, Apps, Tools, Building Blocks, Contact

2. Update the `useMemo` block that adds admin links. The current code pushes "Control Center" for admin users. Keep this behavior, but also add "Ask My Assistant" link for ALL users (not just admin). The final links array should be:

```ts
const links = useMemo(() => {
  const result = [...baseLinks];
  if (user?.email === ADMIN_EMAIL) {
    result.push({ name: "Control Center", href: "/control-center" });
  }
  result.push({ name: "Ask My Assistant", href: "/assistant" });
  return result;
}, [user]);
```

This produces the order: Home, Apps, Tools, Building Blocks, Contact, [Control Center if admin], Ask My Assistant. The Sign in/Account button is already handled by AuthButton component separately in the Navbar, so it naturally appears last.

3. Do NOT change anything else in the component (mobile menu, desktop nav rendering, isActive logic, styling).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — no errors. Verify `baseLinks` has exactly 5 items in the correct order. Verify "Ask My Assistant" is added for all users. Verify "Control Center" is conditionally added for admin only. Verify "About", "Custom GPTs", and "Assistant" are no longer in baseLinks.
  </verify>
  <done>
Navbar renders links in order: Home, Apps, Tools, Building Blocks, Contact, [Control Center], Ask My Assistant, [Sign in/Account button]. Old links (About, Custom GPTs, Assistant) are removed from navbar.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Remove brand scraper from Control Center</name>
  <files>src/components/admin/ControlCenterNav.tsx, src/app/control-center/brand-scraper/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
1. Edit `src/components/admin/ControlCenterNav.tsx`: Remove the brand scraper entry from the `navLinks` array. The array should become:
```ts
const navLinks = [
  { name: "Dashboard", href: "/control-center", exact: true },
  { name: "Content Editor", href: "/control-center/content", exact: false },
  { name: "Billing", href: "/control-center/billing", exact: false },
];
```
Simply remove the `{ name: "Brands", href: "/control-center/brand-scraper", exact: false }` entry. Do NOT change any other code in the component.

2. Delete the file `src/app/control-center/brand-scraper/page.tsx`. Use `rm` or equivalent — this page is no longer needed since brand scraper is accessed only via /apps/brand-scraper.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` — no errors. Verify `ControlCenterNav.tsx` has exactly 3 nav links (Dashboard, Content Editor, Billing). Verify `src/app/control-center/brand-scraper/page.tsx` no longer exists. Run `npm run lint` — no errors.
  </verify>
  <done>
Control Center nav shows Dashboard, Content Editor, Billing only. No "Brands" link. /control-center/brand-scraper returns 404. Users access brand scraper only via /apps/brand-scraper.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` passes with zero errors
2. `npm run lint` passes with zero errors
3. Navbar link order matches requirement: Home, Apps, Tools, Building Blocks, Contact, Control Center (admin), Ask My Assistant, Sign in/Account
4. Control Center nav has no brand scraper link
5. /control-center/brand-scraper page is deleted
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Navbar links appear in the required order per NAV-03
- "Tools" link points to /tools (created in plan 01)
- "Ask My Assistant" link appears for all users
- Brand scraper is completely removed from Control Center (NAV-04)
- Build and lint pass cleanly
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/36-tools-page-and-nav-restructure/36-02-SUMMARY.md`
