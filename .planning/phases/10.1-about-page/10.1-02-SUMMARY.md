# Phase 10.1 Plan 02: About Page UI Summary

**AccomplishmentCard component with 2-column grid page and dynamic detail pages for 7 career accomplishments**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-06T00:39:12Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-06T00:42:10Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files created:** 3

## Accomplishments

- AccomplishmentCard component displaying company, title, role/years, description, and skill tags
- About page with responsive 2-column grid matching Building Blocks style
- 7 detail pages statically generated with Setup, Work Completed, Results, Skills Unlocked sections
- Logo placeholders with company initials ready for future logo uploads

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create AccomplishmentCard component** - `8954927` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create main About page** - `a647464` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Create accomplishment detail page** - `6b53601` (feat)

## Files Created

- `src/components/about/AccomplishmentCard.tsx` - Card component with Link wrapper, logo placeholder, skill tag overflow
- `src/app/about/page.tsx` - Main About page with 2-column responsive grid
- `src/app/about/[slug]/page.tsx` - Detail page with generateStaticParams for all 7 accomplishments

## Decisions Made

- **Max 4 skill tags on cards:** Shows first 4 skills with "+N more" indicator to prevent visual overflow
- **Next.js Image component:** Used for logo images (when provided) for automatic optimization
- **Conditional section rendering:** Setup, Work Completed, Results, Skills Unlocked only render if data exists

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Fixed Biome linting errors**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (AccomplishmentCard) and Task 3 (detail page)
- **Issue:** Biome required Next.js Image component instead of img tag, import ordering
- **Fix:** Changed to Image component with width/height props, reordered imports
- **Files modified:** src/components/about/AccomplishmentCard.tsx, src/app/about/[slug]/page.tsx
- **Verification:** `npx biome check` passes on all files
- **Committed in:** 8954927 (Task 1), 6b53601 (Task 3)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (blocking - linting)
**Impact on plan:** Minor fix required for linter compliance. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

None - plan executed smoothly.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- About page fully functional at /about
- All 7 accomplishment detail pages statically generated
- Ready for Plan 03 (verification and polish) or future enhancements
- Logo placeholders ready for actual company logos when available
