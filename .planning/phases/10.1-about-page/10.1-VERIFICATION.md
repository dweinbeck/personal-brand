### Human Verification Required

None. All phase goals are programmatically verifiable and have been verified.

**Optional manual checks (non-blocking):**
1. **Visual appearance check** — Visit /about and verify card layout looks consistent with Projects/Building Blocks pages
2. **Navigation flow** — Click through a few cards to detail pages and back
3. **Mobile responsive** — Check on small screen that grid collapses to 1 column

These are polish/UX checks — the technical implementation is complete and verified.
