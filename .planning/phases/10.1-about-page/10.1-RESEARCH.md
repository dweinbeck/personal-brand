# Phase 10.1: About Page - Research

**Researched:** 2026-02-05
**Domain:** Next.js App Router page with card grid and dynamic routes
**Confidence:** HIGH

## Summary

This phase implements an "About" page displaying career accomplishments in an interactive card format, mirroring the existing Projects and Building Blocks page patterns. The codebase already has well-established patterns for card components, grid layouts, and dynamic routing that should be followed exactly.

The primary work involves: (1) creating an accomplishments data file, (2) building an AccomplishmentCard component that follows the DetailedProjectCard pattern, (3) creating the /about page with a 2-column grid, and (4) adding dynamic detail pages at /about/[slug] following the building-blocks/[slug] pattern. All styling, data structures, and routing patterns are already established in the codebase.

**Primary recommendation:** Follow the DetailedProjectCard component pattern for accomplishment cards, use a JSON data file for accomplishments, and replicate the building-blocks/[slug] pattern for detail pages.

## Standard Stack

The established libraries/tools for this domain:

### Core (Already in Use)
| Library | Version | Purpose | Why Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|--------------|
| Next.js | 16 | App Router, RSC, dynamic routes | Project standard |
| TypeScript | 5.x | Type safety | Project standard |
| Tailwind CSS | 4 | Styling with @theme directive | Project standard |

### Supporting (Already in Use)
| Library | Version | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| clsx | latest | Conditional class merging | Complex className logic |
| next/link | built-in | Internal navigation | Card links to detail pages |

### Alternatives Considered
| Instead of | Could Use | Tradeoff |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| JSON data file | MDX content files | MDX needed only if accomplishments need rich formatted content; JSON simpler for structured data |
| Inline page data | External JSON | JSON file enables reuse across pages and AI assistant knowledge base |

**Installation:**
No new packages required.

## Architecture Patterns

### Recommended Project Structure
```
src/
├── app/
│   └── about/
│       ├── page.tsx            # Main accomplishments grid page
│       └── [slug]/
│           └── page.tsx        # Individual accomplishment detail page
├── components/
│   └── about/
│       ├── AccomplishmentCard.tsx    # Card component for grid
│       └── AccomplishmentsFilter.tsx # Optional: filter by skill/company
├── data/
│   └── accomplishments.json    # Accomplishment data
└── lib/
    └── accomplishments.ts      # Type definitions and data helpers
```

### Pattern 1: Card Component Structure
**What:** Card components render structured data with consistent styling
**When to use:** All accomplishment cards in grid and anywhere accomplishments are displayed
**Source:** Existing DetailedProjectCard.tsx

```typescript
// Based on src/components/projects/DetailedProjectCard.tsx
export interface Accomplishment {
  slug: string;                    // URL-friendly identifier
  title: string;                   // Accomplishment title
  role: string;                    // Job title/position
  years: string;                   // "2019 - 2021" or "2015"
  company: string;                 // Company/organization name
  companyLogo?: string;            // Path to logo (optional, placeholder if missing)
  description: string;             // Short description for card
  skills: string[];                // Tags like ["Change Management", "Scrum", "R"]
  // Detail page content:
  setup?: string;                  // The situation/context
  workCompleted?: string;          // What was done
  results?: string;                // Outcomes achieved
  skillsUnlocked?: string[];       // Expanded skills for detail page
}
```

### Pattern 2: Page Layout with Grid
**What:** Server component page with centered content and 2-column responsive grid
**When to use:** Main /about page
**Source:** Existing Projects page and Building Blocks page

```typescript
// Based on src/app/projects/page.tsx and src/app/building-blocks/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return (
    <div className="mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-text-primary">About</h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-text-secondary">
        Career accomplishments and professional experience.
      </p>
      <div className="mt-10 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        {accomplishments.map((item) => (
          <AccomplishmentCard key={item.slug} accomplishment={item} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Pattern 3: Dynamic Route for Detail Pages
**What:** Server component with generateStaticParams for pre-rendering
**When to use:** Individual accomplishment pages at /about/[slug]
**Source:** Existing building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx

```typescript
// Based on src/app/building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx
interface PageProps {
  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const accomplishments = await getAccomplishments();
  return accomplishments.map((a) => ({ slug: a.slug }));
}

export const dynamicParams = false;

export default async function AccomplishmentDetailPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const accomplishment = await getAccomplishmentBySlug(slug);
  if (!accomplishment) notFound();
  // ... render detail page
}
```

### Pattern 4: Card Styling Consistency
**What:** Consistent card appearance matching existing cards
**Source:** DetailedProjectCard, TutorialCard, ArticleCard

```typescript
// Card container classes (from DetailedProjectCard.tsx)
const cardClasses = `
  relative rounded-2xl border border-border bg-surface p-8
  shadow-[var(--shadow-card)] transition-all duration-200
  hover:shadow-[var(--shadow-card-hover)] motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-1
  group flex flex-col
`;

// Title styling with hover effect
const titleClasses = `
  text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary
  group-hover:text-gold transition-colors duration-200
`;

// Tag/skill pill styling
const tagClasses = `
  px-2.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-text-tertiary
  bg-[rgba(27,42,74,0.04)] rounded-full
`;
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- **Creating new card styles:** Use existing card styling patterns exactly; don't invent new visual treatments
- **Hardcoding accomplishment data in components:** Data belongs in JSON file for reusability
- **Using different grid layouts:** Match the `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6` pattern
- **Missing hover states:** All cards must have hover:shadow-[var(--shadow-card-hover)] and title color change

## Don't Hand-Roll

Problems that look simple but have existing solutions:

| Problem | Don't Build | Use Instead | Why |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-----|
| Card hover effects | Custom CSS animations | Existing `motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-1` | Consistent UX across site |
| Badge/tag styling | New badge components | Existing `px-2.5 py-0.5 rounded-full` pattern | Visual consistency |
| Grid responsiveness | Custom breakpoints | `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2` | Matches Projects/Building Blocks |
| Dynamic routes | Custom routing logic | Next.js App Router `[slug]` convention | Framework standard |
| Page container | New layout wrapper | `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16` | Site-wide consistency |

**Key insight:** Every visual and structural pattern needed for this page already exists in the codebase. The task is replication and adaptation, not invention.

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Inconsistent Card Heights
**What goes wrong:** Cards in grid have different heights based on content length, looking uneven
**Why it happens:** Variable description lengths, different numbers of tags
**How to avoid:** Use `line-clamp-3` on descriptions, limit visible tags, use `flex flex-col` with `flex-grow` on card body
**Warning signs:** Cards visually misaligned when viewing grid

### Pitfall 2: Missing generateStaticParams Export
**What goes wrong:** Build fails or pages render dynamically instead of statically
**Why it happens:** Next.js 16 requires explicit static params for dynamic routes in production
**How to avoid:** Always export generateStaticParams returning all slugs, set dynamicParams = false
**Warning signs:** Build warnings about dynamic server usage

### Pitfall 3: Params as Promise (Next.js 16)
**What goes wrong:** TypeScript errors or runtime issues accessing route params
**Why it happens:** Next.js 15+ changed params from direct object to Promise
**How to avoid:** Always `await params` before accessing: `const { slug } = await params;`
**Warning signs:** Type errors on `params.slug`

### Pitfall 4: Hardcoded Navigation Links
**What goes wrong:** "About" link missing from navbar after page creation
**Why it happens:** Forgetting to update NavLinks.tsx baseLinks array
**How to avoid:** Update NavLinks.tsx to include { name: "About", href: "/about" }
**Warning signs:** Page exists but not accessible from navigation

### Pitfall 5: Logo Placeholder Implementation
**What goes wrong:** Missing or broken images where logos should appear
**Why it happens:** User specified logos will be uploaded later; need placeholder now
**How to avoid:** Use conditional rendering with placeholder div showing company initial or generic icon
**Warning signs:** Broken image icons, empty spaces in cards

## Code Examples

Verified patterns from the codebase:

### Card with Link to Detail Page
```typescript
// Based on src/components/building-blocks/TutorialCard.tsx
import Link from "next/link";

export function AccomplishmentCard({ accomplishment }: { accomplishment: Accomplishment }) {
  return (
    <Link
      href={`/about/${accomplishment.slug}`}
      className="relative rounded-2xl border border-border bg-surface p-8 shadow-[var(--shadow-card)] transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-[var(--shadow-card-hover)] motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-1 group cursor-pointer block"
    >
      {/* Company with logo placeholder */}
      <div className="flex items-center gap-3 mb-4">
        {accomplishment.companyLogo ? (
          <img
            src={accomplishment.companyLogo}
            alt={accomplishment.company}
            className="h-8 w-8 object-contain"
          />
        ) : (
          <div className="h-8 w-8 rounded bg-gold-light flex items-center justify-center text-gold font-bold text-sm">
            {accomplishment.company.charAt(0)}
          </div>
        )}
        <span className="text-sm font-medium text-text-secondary">
          {accomplishment.company}
        </span>
      </div>

      {/* Title */}
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary group-hover:text-gold transition-colors duration-200">
        {accomplishment.title}
      </h3>

      {/* Role and Years subtitle */}
      <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-text-tertiary">
        {accomplishment.role} &bull; {accomplishment.years}
      </p>

      {/* Description */}
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed line-clamp-3">
        {accomplishment.description}
      </p>

      {/* Skills tags */}
      <div className="mt-5 flex flex-wrap gap-2">
        {accomplishment.skills.slice(0, 4).map((skill) => (
          <span
            key={skill}
            className="px-2.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-text-tertiary bg-[rgba(27,42,74,0.04)] rounded-full"
          >
            {skill}
          </span>
        ))}
        {accomplishment.skills.length > 4 && (
          <span className="px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs text-text-tertiary">
            +{accomplishment.skills.length - 4} more
          </span>
        )}
      </div>

      {/* View details link */}
      <span className="mt-5 inline-block text-sm font-medium text-gold group-hover:text-gold-hover transition-colors duration-200">
        View Details &rarr;
      </span>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

### Detail Page Layout
```typescript
// Based on src/app/building-blocks/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function AccomplishmentDetailPage({ params }: PageProps) {
  const { slug } = await params;
  const accomplishment = await getAccomplishmentBySlug(slug);

  if (!accomplishment) notFound();

  return (
    <article className="mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16">

## State of the Art

| Old Approach | Current Approach | When Changed | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Pages Router `getStaticPaths` | App Router `generateStaticParams` | Next.js 13+ | Use new export function syntax |
| `params` as direct object | `params` as Promise | Next.js 15 | Must await params before accessing |
| ESLint | Biome | Project decision | Use `biome check` not `eslint` |

**Deprecated/outdated:**
- getStaticPaths/getStaticProps: Replaced by App Router conventions
- Direct params access: Must use `await params` in Next.js 15+

## Open Questions

Things that couldn't be fully resolved:

1. **Filter functionality needed?**
   - What we know: Projects page has filter by tag and sort; Building Blocks does not
   - What's unclear: Whether About page should have filter by skill/company
   - Recommendation: Start without filter (simpler); can add later if requested

2. **Accomplishment ordering**
   - What we know: Projects sorted by date; Building Blocks by publication date
   - What's unclear: Should accomplishments be chronological (newest first) or curated order?
   - Recommendation: Default to reverse chronological (newest first) to highlight recent experience

3. **Detail page depth**
   - What we know: User wants Setup, Work Completed, Results, Skills Unlocked
   - What's unclear: How much content per section (single paragraph vs multiple?)
   - Recommendation: Start with substantial paragraphs; user can edit JSON to adjust

4. **Nav position for "About"**
   - What we know: Current nav order is Home, Projects, Building Blocks, Writing, Assistant, Contact
   - What's unclear: Where "About" should appear
   - Recommendation: Insert after "Home" as it's a primary identity page: Home, About, Projects...
