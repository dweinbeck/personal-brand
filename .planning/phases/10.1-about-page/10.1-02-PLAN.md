<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create AccomplishmentCard component</name>
  <files>src/components/about/AccomplishmentCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/about/AccomplishmentCard.tsx` following the DetailedProjectCard pattern:

1. Import Link from "next/link" and Accomplishment type from "@/lib/accomplishments"

2. Create AccomplishmentCard component that renders:
   - Entire card is a Link to `/about/${accomplishment.slug}`
   - Card container with existing styling: `rounded-2xl border border-border bg-surface p-8 shadow-[var(--shadow-card)] transition-all duration-200 hover:shadow-[var(--shadow-card-hover)] motion-safe:hover:-translate-y-1 group cursor-pointer block`

   - Company row with logo placeholder:
     - If companyLogo exists: `<img>` with `h-8 w-8 object-contain`
     - Else: `<div>` with `h-8 w-8 rounded bg-gold-light flex items-center justify-center text-gold font-bold text-sm` showing company initial
     - Company name in `text-sm font-medium text-text-secondary`

   - Title: `text-lg font-semibold text-text-primary group-hover:text-gold transition-colors duration-200`

   - Role and Years subtitle: `mt-1 text-sm text-text-tertiary` with format "{role} • {years}"

   - Description: `mt-3 text-sm text-text-secondary leading-relaxed line-clamp-3`

   - Skills tags (max 4 visible): `mt-5 flex flex-wrap gap-2`
     - Each tag: `px-2.5 py-0.5 font-mono text-xs text-text-tertiary bg-[rgba(27,42,74,0.04)] rounded-full`
     - If >4 skills, show "+{N} more" text

   - "View Details" link text: `mt-5 inline-block text-sm font-medium text-gold group-hover:text-gold-hover transition-colors duration-200`

3. Export as named export: `export function AccomplishmentCard`

  <verify>
    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - `npx biome check src/components/about/AccomplishmentCard.tsx` passes
  </verify>
  <done>
    - AccomplishmentCard component exists and exports correctly
    - Component renders all required fields
    - Logo placeholder shows company initial when no logo
    - Card is fully clickable and links to detail page
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create main About page</name>
  <files>src/app/about/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/app/about/page.tsx` following the Building Blocks page pattern:

1. Import Metadata type from "next"
2. Import AccomplishmentCard from "@/components/about/AccomplishmentCard"
3. Import getAccomplishments from "@/lib/accomplishments"

4. Export metadata:
   ```typescript
   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: "About",
     description: "Career accomplishments and professional experience of Dan Weinbeck.",
   };
   ```

5. Create default async function AboutPage:
   - Fetch accomplishments: `const accomplishments = await getAccomplishments();`
   - Return JSX with:
     - Container: `mx-auto max-w-5xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16`
     - Title: `text-3xl font-bold text-text-primary` with text "About"
     - Subtitle: `mt-2 text-text-secondary` with "Career accomplishments and professional experience."
     - Grid: `mt-10 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`
     - Map accomplishments to AccomplishmentCard components

This matches the Building Blocks page layout exactly.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run dev` and navigate to /about - page renders with card grid
    - Grid shows 2 columns on desktop, 1 column on mobile
    - All 7 accomplishment cards display
  </verify>
  <done>
    - About page renders at /about
    - Cards display in 2-column responsive grid
    - All accomplishments from data file are displayed
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create accomplishment detail page</name>
  <files>src/app/about/[slug]/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create `src/app/about/[slug]/page.tsx` following the building-blocks/[slug] pattern:

1. Imports:
   - Metadata from "next"
   - notFound from "next/navigation"
   - getAccomplishments, getAccomplishmentBySlug, Accomplishment from "@/lib/accomplishments"

2. Interface for props:
   ```typescript
   interface PageProps {
     params: Promise<{ slug: string }>;
   }
   ```

3. generateStaticParams (CRITICAL - Next.js 15+ requires this):
   ```typescript
   export async function generateStaticParams() {
     const accomplishments = await getAccomplishments();
     return accomplishments.map((a) => ({ slug: a.slug }));
   }

   export const dynamicParams = false;
   ```

4. generateMetadata function:
   - `const { slug } = await params;` (CRITICAL: await params)
   - Fetch accomplishment by slug
   - Return title: "{accomplishment.title} | About" and description

5. Default async function AccomplishmentDetailPage:
   - `const { slug } = await params;` (CRITICAL: await params)
   - Fetch accomplishment by slug
   - If not found, call notFound()

   - Return article with:
     - Container: `mx-auto max-w-3xl px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-16`

     - Header section (`mb-10`):
       - Company with logo placeholder (same pattern as card)
       - Title: `text-3xl font-bold text-text-primary`
       - Role and Years: `mt-2 text-lg text-text-secondary`
       - All skills as tags: `mt-4 flex flex-wrap gap-2` with `inline-block rounded-full bg-gold-light px-2.5 py-0.5 text-xs font-medium text-text-primary`

     - Content sections (`prose prose-neutral max-w-none space-y-8`):
       - "The Setup" section (if setup exists): h2 + paragraph
       - "Work Completed" section (if workCompleted exists): h2 + paragraph
       - "Results" section (if results exists): h2 + paragraph
       - "Skills Unlocked" section (if skillsUnlocked exists): h2 + flex wrap of skill badges

     - Back link at bottom: Link to /about with "Back to About" text
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` succeeds (generateStaticParams works)
    - Navigate to /about/3m-marketing-analytics-leader - detail page renders
    - All sections (Setup, Work Completed, Results, Skills Unlocked) display when present
    - Back link navigates to /about
  </verify>
  <done>
