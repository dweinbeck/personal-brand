<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add About link to navigation</name>
  <files>src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update NavLinks.tsx to include About in the navigation:

1. Add `{ name: "About", href: "/about" }` to the baseLinks array
2. Position it after "Home" and before "Projects" (index 1)

Current order: Home, Projects, Building Blocks, Writing, Assistant, Contact
New order: Home, About, Projects, Building Blocks, Writing, Assistant, Contact

This ensures About is prominently placed as an identity/biography page.

  <verify>
    - `grep -n "About" src/components/layout/NavLinks.tsx` shows About in baseLinks
    - `npm run dev` and navigate - About appears in navbar between Home and Projects
  </verify>
  <done>
