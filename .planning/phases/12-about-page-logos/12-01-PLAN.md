<objective>
Add company and university logos to accomplishment cards on the About page.

Purpose: Visual recognition improves scanning speed and adds professional polish. Users can quickly identify familiar brands (3M, Disney, Tufts) which builds credibility.

Output: Logo files in public/images/logos/ and updated accomplishments.json with logo paths. AccomplishmentCard.tsx already has logo rendering logic (conditional Image vs placeholder).

  <name>Task 1: Add logo files and update accomplishment data</name>
  <files>
    public/images/logos/3m.svg
    public/images/logos/darden.svg
    public/images/logos/disney.svg

  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create public/images/logos/ directory

    2. Source and add logo files for each company/university:
       - 3M Corporation: Official 3M logo (red "3M" text)
       - Darden Restaurants: Darden logo (parent company of Olive Garden, LongHorn)
       - Walt Disney World: Disney "D" or castle icon
       - University of Iowa: Tigerhawk or "Iowa" wordmark (gold/black)
       - Tufts University: Tufts "T" logo or elephant mascot

    3. Logo requirements:
       - Format: SVG preferred (scalable), PNG acceptable
       - Size: Should render cleanly at 32x32px (per AccomplishmentCard.tsx)
       - Background: Transparent or works on white/light backgrounds
       - Quality: Official/recognizable versions

    4. Update src/data/accomplishments.json:
       - Set companyLogo field for each accomplishment
       - Use relative paths from public: "/images/logos/3m.svg"
       - 3M Corporation (3 accomplishments) all use same logo path
       - Each of the 5 unique entities gets one logo file

    Logo mapping:
    - "3M Corporation" → "/images/logos/3m.svg" (used by 3 accomplishments)
    - "Darden Restaurants" → "/images/logos/darden.svg"
    - "Walt Disney World" → "/images/logos/disney.svg"
    - "University of Iowa Tippie School of Business" → "/images/logos/iowa.svg"
    - "Tufts University" → "/images/logos/tufts.svg"

    Note: AccomplishmentCard.tsx already handles logo rendering via next/image when companyLogo is truthy. No component changes needed.

  <name>Task 2: Verify logo display on About page</name>
  <what-built>Company and university logos added to all 7 accomplishment cards on the About page</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npm run dev` if not already running
    2. Visit http://localhost:3000/about
    3. Verify each accomplishment card shows its company/university logo:
       - 3M logo appears on all 3 3M accomplishment cards
       - Darden logo appears on the Darden card
       - Disney logo appears on the Walt Disney World card
       - Iowa Tigerhawk/wordmark appears on the MBA card
       - Tufts logo appears on the BA card
    4. Check logo sizing: logos should be ~32x32px, positioned left of company name
    5. Check logo clarity: logos should be crisp, not pixelated or stretched
    6. Click into one accomplishment detail page (e.g., /about/3m-marketing-analytics-leader) to verify logo appears there too if applicable
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if logos look good, or describe any issues (wrong logo, poor quality, sizing problems, etc.)</resume-signal>
