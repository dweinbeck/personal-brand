# Phase 48.1 Plan 01: Remove HelpTip Icons and Add Home Link Summary

**Removed all HelpTip (? icon) components from 5 files, deleted 3 infrastructure files, and added Home nav link to sidebar**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 17 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-19T13:41:07Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-19T13:58:49Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 8 (5 modified, 3 deleted)

## Accomplishments
- Removed all HelpTip component usages from sidebar, section-header, project-view, tag-list, and search-input
- Deleted help-tip.tsx component, help-tips.ts data file, and use-tooltip-position.ts hook
- Added "Home" as the first navigation item in the sidebar with href="/apps/tasks" and home SVG icon

## Task Commits

Both tasks were committed together atomically (since Task 2 modified a file already changed by Task 1):

1. **Task 1+2: Remove HelpTip icons and add Home link** - `ed4a9f2` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/tasks/sidebar.tsx` - Removed HelpTip import/usage, added Home nav item with home icon
- `src/components/tasks/section-header.tsx` - Removed HelpTip import/usage from section names
- `src/app/apps/tasks/(authenticated)/[projectId]/project-view.tsx` - Removed HelpTip import/usage from view mode toggle
- `src/app/apps/tasks/(authenticated)/tags/tag-list.tsx` - Removed HelpTip import/usage from manage tags header
- `src/app/apps/tasks/(authenticated)/search/search-input.tsx` - Removed HelpTip import/usage from search header
- `src/components/tasks/ui/help-tip.tsx` - DELETED (HelpTip component)
- `src/data/help-tips.ts` - DELETED (help tips data)
- `src/lib/hooks/use-tooltip-position.ts` - DELETED (tooltip positioning hook)

## Decisions Made
- Combined Task 1 and Task 2 into a single commit since Task 2 modified sidebar.tsx which was already modified by Task 1
- Preserved drag-and-drop functionality that was added to project-view.tsx by a concurrent plan execution (48.1-03/04)

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 - Blocking] Preserved concurrent drag-and-drop changes in project-view.tsx**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (Remove HelpTip usages)
- **Issue:** Another plan (48.1-03/04) concurrently modified project-view.tsx adding drag-and-drop functionality with new imports (assignTaskToSectionAction, cn) and state (draggingTaskId, dragOverSection)
- **Fix:** Preserved all drag-and-drop code while only removing HelpTip import and usage
- **Files modified:** src/app/apps/tasks/(authenticated)/[projectId]/project-view.tsx
- **Verification:** grep confirms no HelpTip references; build passes
- **Committed in:** ed4a9f2

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 blocking - concurrent file modification)
**Impact on plan:** Auto-fix preserved concurrent work from other plans. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
- Concurrent plan execution by other agents repeatedly overwrote file changes, requiring multiple re-application of edits before successful commit
- Next.js Turbopack build had intermittent ENOENT errors on _buildManifest.js.tmp (pre-existing infrastructure issue unrelated to code changes); resolved by killing stale processes and retrying

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Tasks app UI is clean with no help tip icons
- Sidebar has full navigation: Home, Today, Completed, Search, Filters & Tags
- Ready for subsequent UI polish plans in phase 48.1
