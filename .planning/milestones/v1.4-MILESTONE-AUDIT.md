## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: Content Editor Authoring ✓

Admin → Control Center → Content Editor nav → Tutorial listing → New Tutorial → Fill form → Preview → Save → MDX written to filesystem → Listing updated

All 12 steps traced through code. No breaks.

### Flow 2: Brand Scraper Job ✓

Admin → Control Center → Brand Scraper nav → URL form → Submit → API proxy → External service → Job ID returned → SWR polling → Status updates → Gallery renders → Download links → Reset

All 16 steps traced through code. No breaks.

### Flow 3: Cross-Feature Navigation ✓

Dashboard → Brand Scraper → Content Editor → Dashboard. Active state correctly follows `usePathname()` with exact match for Dashboard, prefix match for sub-sections.

**Score: 3/3 flows verified (100%)**

## Anti-Patterns and Tech Debt

**None found.** Scanned all phase VERIFICATION.md files:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in delivered code
- No placeholder implementations or stubs
- No console.log statements
- No dead code or orphaned files
- No type safety issues (`any` types)

## Deployment Considerations

1. **BRAND_SCRAPER_API_URL** must be configured in Cloud Build trigger before deploying brand scraper features
2. **Content editor** writes are dev-only — Cloud Run filesystem is ephemeral, `NODE_ENV !== "development"` gate prevents production writes
3. **Custom GPTs data** has placeholder URLs in `src/data/custom-gpts.json` — update before production use

## Milestone Statistics

- **Phases:** 6 (including 1 inserted phase: 19.1)
- **Plans executed:** 9
- **Total must-haves verified:** 37
- **Files created/modified:** ~30 across all phases
- **Dependencies added:** swr, react-markdown, remark-gfm
- **New API routes:** 2 (brand scraper submit + poll)
- **New components:** ~15 (editor, nav, gallery cards, etc.)
