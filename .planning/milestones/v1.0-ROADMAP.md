# Milestone v1.0: MVP

## Overview

This roadmap delivered Dan's personal website in six phases, progressing from a navigable shell through content pages, dynamic GitHub integration, contact functionality, SEO polish, and finally production deployment on GCP Cloud Run.

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**

- Phase 2.1: Building Blocks (inserted after Phase 2 for tutorials section with concrete, simple guides)

**Key Decisions:**

- Next.js 16 + Tailwind v4 + Biome v2.3 + Motion v12 stack
- SSG for most pages, ISR for GitHub data, SSR only for contact API route
- Firebase Admin SDK only (no client SDK needed)
- NavLinks as only "use client" component; server/client split pattern
- Tutorial metadata uses exported const objects (not YAML frontmatter) for type-safe extraction
- ISR data fetching pattern: { next: { revalidate: 3600 } } on fetch for hourly cache
- Server Action pattern: useActionState + Zod safeParse + flatten for field-level errors
- In-memory rate limiting (3/15min/IP) sufficient for single-server personal site
- ADC detection via K_SERVICE env var for Cloud Run; cert() fallback for local dev
- Three-stage Dockerfile (deps, builder, runner) on node:20-alpine with non-root user
- Cloud Build pattern for serverless Docker builds (no local Docker needed)
- Dedicated service account per Cloud Run service with least-privilege IAM

**Issues Resolved:**

- Next.js 16 removed eslint config; Biome handles all linting natively
- Desktop nav padding reduced from px-3 to px-2 to accommodate 6 links without wrapping
- Child pages omit openGraph to inherit from root layout (avoids Next.js shallow merge pitfall)

**Issues Deferred:**

- OG image is a 1x1 placeholder — replace with branded 1200x630 image for social sharing
- CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Placeholder OG image needs replacement before production social sharing is optimal
- No automated CI/CD — manual deploy script only
