## v1.8 Requirements

Requirements for Tasks App integration milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Help Tips

- [x] **TIPS-01**: User can see a gold "?" icon next to key UI elements that provides contextual help on hover or focus
- [x] **TIPS-02**: HelpTip component is accessible (ARIA tooltip role, keyboard focus trigger, Escape to dismiss)
- [x] **TIPS-03**: Help tip content is centralized in a catalog file for easy updates
- [x] **TIPS-04**: Help tips render correctly on mobile (tap-to-toggle, max-width constraint, viewport-aware positioning)

### Effort Scoring

- [x] **EFFORT-01**: User can assign an optional effort score (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, or 13) to any task
- [x] **EFFORT-02**: User can see a visual effort selector when creating or editing a task
- [x] **EFFORT-03**: User can see the sum of effort scores for all incomplete tasks in a section
- [x] **EFFORT-04**: User can see the sum of effort scores for all incomplete tasks in a project
- [x] **EFFORT-05**: Unscored tasks display distinctly (not as 0) and are excluded from rollup totals

### Multi-User + Auth

- [x] **AUTH-01**: User can sign in to the todoist app via Google Sign-In (Firebase Auth, same project as personal-brand)
- [x] **AUTH-02**: Each user's data is scoped by userId — users cannot see or modify other users' data
- [x] **AUTH-03**: All Prisma queries include userId filter to prevent cross-user data leaks
- [x] **AUTH-04**: Server derives userId from verified Firebase token — never accepts userId from client input

### Weekly Credit Gating

- [x] **BILL-01**: User's first week of task management access is free (from first access timestamp)
- [x] **BILL-02**: After the free week, user is charged 100 credits/week for read-write access
- [x] **BILL-03**: When user has insufficient credits, app degrades to read-only mode (all data visible, writes disabled)
- [x] **BILL-04**: Server returns 402 on all mutation endpoints when user is in read-only mode
- [x] **BILL-05**: User sees a ReadOnlyBanner when in read-only mode with a "Buy Credits" CTA
- [x] **BILL-06**: User sees a FreeWeekBanner during their free trial week explaining upcoming charges
- [x] **BILL-07**: Billing check uses idempotency key (`tasks_week_<weekStart>`) to prevent double-charging
- [x] **BILL-08**: `tasks_app` tool pricing entry exists in `billing_tool_pricing` Firestore collection

### Apps Integration

- [x] **APPS-01**: Tasks app appears on the /apps page with correct metadata (title, description, tech stack)
- [x] **APPS-02**: Tasks app entry links to the deployed todoist service URL
- [x] **APPS-03**: Sitemap includes the tasks app entry

### Demo Workspace

- [x] **DEMO-01**: Unauthenticated visitor can view a pre-populated demo workspace with 30-60 realistic tasks across 3-5 projects
- [x] **DEMO-02**: Demo workspace showcases effort scores, subtasks, tags, and multiple project structures
- [x] **DEMO-03**: Demo workspace runs entirely client-side with no database writes or API calls
- [x] **DEMO-04**: Demo mode displays a persistent "DEMO" banner explaining data is temporary with CTA to sign up
- [x] **DEMO-05**: All mutation UI elements are disabled or show feedback in demo mode (no silent failures)

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Unit tests verify billing access check logic (enabled/disabled, free week, paid week, insufficient credits)
- [x] **TEST-02**: Unit tests verify effort rollup computation (null handling, section sum, project sum)

## Future Requirements

Deferred to a later milestone. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Effort Scoring Enhancements

- **EFFORT-06**: User can see an effort distribution visualization (bar chart across sections)
- **EFFORT-07**: Effort badges appear in board view cards with column totals

### Demo Enhancements

- **DEMO-06**: User can keep demo workspace data after signing up and paying
- **DEMO-07**: Guided tour walks user through demo workspace features

### Billing Enhancements

- **BILL-09**: User can see their credit balance in the todoist app header
- **BILL-10**: User can view billing history for tasks app charges

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Todoist parity (filters, labels, NLP dates, reminders, collaboration) | Not needed for personal productivity tool |
| Stripe subscriptions for tasks | Pre-paid credits model is intentional |
| Per-task billing (charge per task created) | Discourages natural task creation behavior; weekly flat rate is better UX |
| Feature-tiered access (free basic, paid premium features) | App is simple enough that partial access feels broken |
| Embedding todoist as pages in personal-brand repo | Different databases and mutation patterns; keep as separate deployment |
| Prisma 7.x upgrade | Major version bump during feature work adds unnecessary risk |
| Real-time WebSocket updates | Single-user app, page revalidation sufficient |
| Drag-and-drop task reordering | Already uses manual ordering; DnD is a v2+ enhancement |
