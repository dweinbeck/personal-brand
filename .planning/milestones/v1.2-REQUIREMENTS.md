## v1.2 Requirements

**Defined:** 2026-02-06
**Core Value:** Visitors can understand who Dan is and see proof of his work within 60 seconds

### Projects

- [x] **PROJ-02**: Each project card links to an individual detail page
- [x] **PROJ-03**: Project detail page shows full README content, tech stack, dates, and links
- [x] **PROJ-04**: Homepage featured projects use same data source as projects page (unified)

## Future Requirements (Deferred)

### Writing

- **WRIT-02**: Individual article pages render MDX content with code highlighting
- **WRIT-03**: At least one real article published

### About

- **ABOU-02**: Logo assets are optimized (SVG preferred, PNG fallback)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Tag filtering on projects page | Not enough projects yet to justify |
| GitHub activity sparklines | Adds API complexity for minimal value |
| RSS feed | Defer until writing content exists |
| Dynamic per-page OG images | Single branded image sufficient for now |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| PROJ-01 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| PROJ-02 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| PROJ-03 | Phase 11 | Complete |
| PROJ-04 | Phase 11 | Complete |
