# Milestone v1.2: Content & Data Integration

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-07
**Phases:** 11-12
**Total Plans:** 4

## Overview

Replace placeholder project data with live GitHub API across the site, add individual project detail pages with README rendering, and polish the About page with company/university logos.

## Phases

### Phase 11: GitHub API Integration

**Goal**: Projects page and homepage display live data from GitHub API with individual project detail pages
**Depends on**: Phase 10.1 (About Page)
**Requirements**: PROJ-01, PROJ-02, PROJ-03, PROJ-04
**Plans**: 3 plans in 2 waves

Plans:
- [x] 11-01: Data layer — project config, types, GitHub API functions
- [x] 11-02: Projects page with live data + detail pages with README rendering
- [x] 11-03: Homepage featured projects unification + sitemap update

**Success Criteria:**
1. Projects page displays live repository data from GitHub API (not placeholder data)
2. Each project card links to its own detail page at `/projects/[slug]`
3. Project detail page shows full README content rendered as markdown
4. Project detail page displays tech stack, creation date, last update date, and links
5. Homepage featured projects pull from the same GitHub data source as projects page

### Phase 12: About Page Logos

**Goal**: Accomplishment cards display company and university logos for visual recognition
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: ABOU-01
**Plans**: 1 plan in 1 wave

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Add logo files and update accomplishment data with logo paths

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each accomplishment card displays the relevant company or university logo
2. Logos are appropriately sized and positioned on cards
3. Logos work on both light backgrounds and maintain brand recognition

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Featured projects: personal-brand, bus-multiplier, envelope app, 60-second lesson
- Private repos get visibility: private with curated-only data
- 1-hour ISR caching for all GitHub API calls
- Kept fetchGitHubProjects for backwards compatibility
- ISO date formatting with Intl.DateTimeFormat
- Max 6 featured projects on homepage
- Sitemap uses pushedAt from GitHub API for lastModified
- SVG format for all company/university logos

**Issues Resolved:**

- Logo placeholders from v1.1 replaced with actual SVG logos (3M, Darden, Disney, Iowa, Tufts)
- Duplicate hardcoded project data on homepage eliminated via API unification

**Issues Deferred:**

- GitHub API rate limiting: Public API allows 60 requests/hour unauthenticated; ISR caching mitigates this
- Some GitHub repos return 404 (private repos) — handled gracefully with curated-only fallback

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Legacy fetchGitHubRepos function kept for backwards compatibility (should be removed)
- No authenticated GitHub token — rate limited to 60 requests/hour
