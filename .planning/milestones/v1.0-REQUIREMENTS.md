| Comments system | Adds moderation burden, low value |
| Real-time features (WebSockets) | Unnecessary complexity |
| Video hosting | Storage/bandwidth costs; use YouTube embeds if needed |
| Multi-language support | English only, Dan's audience is English-speaking |
| Custom analytics dashboard | Use Google Analytics or Plausible directly |
| OAuth / magic link login | No login needed |
| Mobile app | Web-first, no native app |
