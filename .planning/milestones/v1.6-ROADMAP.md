**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-10
**Phases:** 26
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

Visitors can discover and access available tools from a dedicated Apps page with visual card grid, navigation integration, and sitemap coverage.

## Phases

### Phase 26: Apps Hub Page

**Goal**: Visitors can discover and access available tools from a dedicated /apps page
**Depends on**: Phase 25 (v1.5 complete)
**Requirements**: APPS-01, APPS-02, APPS-03, APPS-04, APPS-05, APPS-06, APPS-07, APPS-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visitor navigates to /apps and sees a 2-across card grid of available tools with topic badges, descriptions, tech stack tags, and dates
  2. Visitor clicks "Enter App" on the Brand Scraper card and reaches the existing /apps/brand-scraper page
  3. Visitor sees the Dave Ramsey Digital Envelopes card as "Coming Soon" with a disabled button that cannot be clicked
  4. Visitor sees "Apps" in the main navigation with correct active state highlighting on /apps and /apps/* routes
  5. Search engines discover /apps and /apps/brand-scraper via the sitemap, and lint/test/build all pass
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 26-01-PLAN.md -- Apps data, AppCard component, /apps page, navigation, sitemap

**Details:**

Files created:
- `src/data/apps.ts` — AppListing type and getApps() returning Brand Scraper and Digital Envelopes
- `src/components/apps/AppCard.tsx` — Server component with topic badge, tech tags, dates, conditional button
- `src/app/apps/page.tsx` — Apps index page with metadata and 2-column responsive grid

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Used single TS file for app data (no separate JSON) since only 2 entries
- Empty strings for null dates to keep AppListing interface simple (all string types)
- Card is non-clickable div with only action button interactive (unlike TutorialCard)

**Issues Resolved:**
None — clean single-phase milestone with no issues encountered.

**Issues Deferred:**
None.

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
None detected. Audit found no TODOs, stubs, placeholders, or anti-patterns.
