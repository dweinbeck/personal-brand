# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in values

# --- Firebase (local development) ---
# On Cloud Run, these are NOT needed -- ADC handles auth automatically.
# For local dev, get these from Firebase Console -> Project Settings -> Service Accounts
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# --- GitHub API (optional, for projects page) ---
# Works without auth but may hit rate limits
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# ===========================================
# Production (Cloud Run) Notes
# ===========================================
# On Cloud Run, firebase-admin uses Application Default Credentials (ADC).
# The only env var set in Cloud Run is FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID.
# The Cloud Run service account (cloudrun-site) needs roles/datastore.user
# for Firestore access. Secret Manager is NOT needed -- ADC handles all
# authentication automatically via the service account identity.
# See scripts/deploy.sh for the full deployment process.
