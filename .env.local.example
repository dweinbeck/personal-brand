# ===========================================
# Production (Cloud Run) Notes
# ===========================================
# On Cloud Run, firebase-admin uses Application Default Credentials (ADC).
# The only env var set in Cloud Run is FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID.
# The Cloud Run service account (cloudrun-site) needs roles/datastore.user
# for Firestore access. Secret Manager is NOT needed -- ADC handles all
# authentication automatically via the service account identity.
# See scripts/deploy.sh for the full deployment process.
