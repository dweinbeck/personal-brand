};

A **Custom GPT** that **interviews you** about an MVP, then outputs a single, clean **`FRD.md`** you can paste into your repo.

## What you’ll get
- A reusable GPT you can run for *any* new idea
- A consistent FRD structure (no blank page)
- Faster “idea → build” speed with fewer scope misunderstandings

---

## 10-second FRD summary
An **FRD (Functional Requirements Document)** describes *what you’re building* and *what “done” means*—scope, users, requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria—so you can ship an MVP without thrashing.
---

## Why this building block matters
This is a workflow efficiency move: instead of rewriting prompts or reinventing FRD structure every time, you have a single “requirements engine” that:

- **Standardizes quality**: same sections, same completeness, every time
- **Prevents premature building**: it won’t draft until key info exists
- **Eliminates thrash**: forces clarity on goals, scope, and acceptance criteria
- **Scales across projects**: repeatable, shareable, and easy to iterate

If you’re building fast, you don’t need more motivation—you need **systems**.

---

## What you’re building (spec)
**Name:** FRD-in-a-Box  
**Job:** Interview → Draft `FRD.md`  
**Inputs:** Your answers to a short guided questionnaire  
**Output:** Exactly one Markdown document containing the full FRD

### Output rules (non-negotiable)
When the GPT generates, it must:
- Output **ONLY** the FRD (no commentary)
- Output the FRD in **one fenced `markdown` code block**
- Use **numbered requirements**:
  - `FR-1, FR-2, ...`
  - `NFR-1, NFR-2, ...`
- Mark unknowns as **TBD** and list them in **Open Questions**

---

## Prereqs
- ChatGPT Plus (you already have it)
- A place to store the FRD in your repo (recommended: `/docs/FRD.md` or root `FRD.md`)

---

## Step-by-step: create the Custom GPT (web interface)
You’ll create this in the **ChatGPT web app**.

### 1) Open the GPT Builder
1. Go to **Explore GPTs**
2. Click **+ Create**
3. Switch to the **Configure** tab

> Tip: You can keep this GPT private or “Anyone with link” so you can share it later.

---

### 2) Configure the basics
Set:
- **Name:** `FRD-in-a-Box`
- **Description:** `Interviews you about an MVP and outputs a clean FRD.md in Markdown.`
- **Icon:** optional

---

### 3) Capabilities (keep it lean)
For an FRD generator, you typically want **no tools**:
- Leave browsing OFF (unless you *specifically* want competitor research baked in)
- Leave image generation OFF

The goal is consistent structure and fast output.

---

### 4) Paste the core Instructions
In **Instructions**, paste the following exactly.

```text
You are “FRD-in-a-Box,” an expert product + engineering requirements writer optimized for SPEED and CLARITY.

Primary outcome:
- Ask the user targeted questions to collect inputs for an MVP FRD.
- Do NOT generate the FRD until all required fields are collected (or the user explicitly says “generate with assumptions”).
- When generating: output ONE single Markdown document (no preamble) in a fenced ```markdown block.

Interaction mode:
1) Start by showing a short checklist of required inputs (with empty slots).
2) Ask ONE question at a time.
3) Use smart branching: only ask follow-ups when relevant.
4) After every 3–5 questions, briefly summarize captured decisions and list remaining gaps.
5) If the user is unsure, offer 2–4 common options, then ask them to pick.

Required inputs (must capture before drafting):
- Project name + one-line MVP statement
- Target users + primary user problem
- MVP goal + explicit non-goals
- Core user journey (happy path)
- Functional requirements (at least 5)
- Non-functional requirements (at least 5, e.g., performance, security, reliability)
- Data/integrations (even “none”)
- Success metrics + analytics events	link
- Acceptance criteria for MVP release
- Risks + open questions

Output rules (when drafting):
- Output ONLY the FRD markdown in one fenced ```markdown block.
- Use clear headings and bullet points.
- Requirements must be numbered (FR-1, FR-2…; NFR-1…).
- Every major section should be concise, but complete.
- If info is missing, mark it clearly as TBD and list it again in “Open Questions.”

Tone:
- Efficient, direct, slightly founder-y, no fluff.
