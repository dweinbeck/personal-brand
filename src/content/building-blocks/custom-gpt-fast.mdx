};

This is the fast-track companion to [Setting up a Custom GPT](/building-blocks/custom-gpt). Instead of an interview that asks questions one at a time, this GPT takes everything you throw at it and immediately produces a complete FRD.

### When to use which

| Version | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| [FRD Interviewer](/building-blocks/custom-gpt) | When you have a vague idea and want to be guided |
| **FRD Creator** (this one) | When you already know what you're building and just need the doc |

---

## What you're building (spec)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | FRD Creator |
| Job | Brain dump → `FRD.md` |
| Inputs | A single message describing your project |
| Output | One Markdown FRD in a fenced code block |

### How it differs from the Interviewer

The Interviewer asks questions one at a time and won't generate until every required field is captured. The Creator does the opposite: it takes whatever you give it and fills in the rest with smart defaults, marking true unknowns as TBD.

---

## Prereqs
- ChatGPT Plus
- A project idea (even a rough one)

---

## Step-by-step: create the Custom GPT

### 1) Open the GPT Builder
1. Go to Explore GPTs
2. Click + Create
3. Switch to the Configure tab

---

### 2) Configure the basics

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Name | `FRD Creator` |
| Description | `Paste a project brain dump and get a clean FRD.md instantly.` |
| Icon | optional |

---

### 3) Capabilities (keep it lean)
- Leave browsing OFF
- Leave image generation OFF

Same reasoning as the Interviewer: you want fast, consistent output.

---

### 4) Paste the core Instructions

In the Instructions field, paste the following exactly.

```text
You are "FRD Creator," an expert product + engineering requirements writer optimized for SPEED.

Primary outcome:
- The user will paste a brain dump, project description, or rough spec.
- Immediately generate a complete FRD as ONE Markdown document in a fenced ```markdown block.
- Do NOT interview. Do NOT ask follow-up questions unless the input is truly unintelligible (fewer than ~20 words with no clear product concept).
- If any required section lacks information from the user's input, use reasonable defaults and mark assumptions with "(assumed — verify)" inline. Only use "TBD" for items that truly cannot be inferred.

FRD structure (always use this order):
1. Overview — one-line MVP statement, target users, user problem, MVP goal, non-goals
2. Scope — in scope, out of scope
3. User Journey (Happy Path) — 3–7 numbered steps
4. Functional Requirements — numbered FR-1, FR-2, … (at least 5)
5. Non-Functional Requirements — numbered NFR-1, NFR-2, … (at least 5: performance, security, reliability, privacy, accessibility)
6. Data, Integrations, and Dependencies — data inputs/outputs, APIs, dependencies
7. Analytics and Success Metrics — success metrics, event tracking plan
8. Acceptance Criteria (MVP Release) — numbered AC-1, AC-2, … (at least 3)
9. Risks and Mitigations — each risk with a mitigation
10. Open Questions — any remaining unknowns

Output rules:
- Output ONLY the FRD markdown in one fenced ```markdown block.
- No preamble, no commentary before or after the block.
- Requirements must be numbered (FR-1, FR-2…; NFR-1…; AC-1…).
- Every section must be present, even if short.

Tone:
- Efficient, direct, slightly founder-y, no fluff.
```

### 5) Add Conversation Starters

```
Here's my project idea: …
```

```
Turn this into an FRD: …
```

```
Generate an FRD for: [one-sentence description]
```

### 6) (Optional) Upload a template as Knowledge

Same template as the Interviewer version. Create a file named `frd-template.md`:

```
---
title: "FRD — {{PROJECT_NAME}}"
version: "0.1"
owner: "{{OWNER}}"
last_updated: "{{DATE}}"
status: "Draft"

### 7) Test it

In the Preview pane, paste this:

```
I'm building a personal-brand website that has a portfolio, blog,
contact form, and an AI assistant that can answer questions about
my work. Next.js, Firebase, deployed on Cloud Run.
```

Confirm the output is:
- A single fenced markdown code block
- All 10 sections present
- Requirements are numbered
- Missing info marked as "(assumed — verify)" or "TBD"
- No questions asked back to you

### 8) Publish

Choose one:
- **Only me** (private, safest)
- **Anyone with link** (best for sharing)
- **Public** (only if you're comfortable)

## Example: how you'll use it

Open your FRD Creator GPT and paste:

```
Building a habit tracker. Users log daily habits, see streaks, get
reminders. Mobile-first PWA. Firebase backend, auth with Google,
free tier with optional $5/mo premium for analytics.
```

Copy the markdown output into your repo as `FRD.md` or `/docs/FRD.md`. Review it, verify the assumptions, fill in any TBDs, and you're ready to build.

---

## Success criteria

You'll know this is working when:
- You can produce a solid FRD in under 5 minutes
- The output covers all 10 sections without follow-up questions
- Assumptions are clearly marked so you know what to verify
- The GPT never asks you to clarify before generating
