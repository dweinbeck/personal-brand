    primary_audience:
    - Potential employers (link in resume)
    - Current colleagues / professional network (share on LinkedIn)
    - Friends (share for fun; possibly link from Instagram)
    - Dan himself as a home-base + personal assistant hub (AI assistant built into
      the site to help organize life and manage side-projects)
    primary_action_60s:
      primary_action: Quickly understand who Dan is (professional skillset + personal
        interests) from a casual-but-professional summary.
      supporting_actions:
      - Discover and use a chatbot to ask questions about Dan and/or navigate the
        site
      - View Dan's public GitHub repositories
      - Find Dan's email address quickly for contact
      tone_note: One step more casual than LinkedIn, still professional.

      linkedin_bio_text: 'I’m a business intelligence and data science professional
        with over 10 years of experience in analytics leadership and business strategy.
        I''ve helped transform the analytics function at 3 Fortune 500 companies and
        am currently working as a Director of Data & Analytics at Transparent Partners.
        I''m the account lead for a Fortune 25 health care company and my current
        passion is AI Agent Development.


        Some examples of my impact include:

        - In current role as a marketing consultant, I am helping to design the customer
        data platform architecture for an industry-leading healthcare services company.

        - As a data intelligence leader supporting a $2 billion sales organization,
        I helped design, build, and deploy a sales reporting system used by over 600
        sales reps and managers on a daily basis, resulting in more efficient sales
        coverage and increased sales per visit.

        - I’ve pushed for strategic change within every organization I’ve worked for
        - for example by establishing and managing a 6 person data science team consisting
        of statisticians, software developers, and analysts. This team helped 3M Industrial
        Business leaders optimize their strategic and operational plans using statistical
        models.

        - As a marketing analytics leader supporting a $12 billion global organization
        at 3M Company, I created and implemented a strategic plan to establish a marketing
        analytics function. This resulted in a 10-person team building a suite of
        reporting & analysis tools for over 1000 marketers. This organization enabled
        granular measurement to quantify the impact of marketing campaigns in real-time.'

  goals:
  - 'Give first-time visitors a fast, casual-but-professional understanding of who
    Dan is: skillset + interests'
  - 'Provide clear ways to engage: chatbot Q&A / site navigation, and obvious contact
    options'
  - 'Show proof-of-work: public GitHub repos and (later) richer case studies'
  - 'Serve as Dan’s personal home-base: AI assistant + organization for life and side-projects'
  constraints:
  - Ship MVP in 24 hours
  - Host on GCP Cloud Run; use Firestore + Cloud Storage
  - Secure-by-default (least privilege, secret management, basic abuse protection)
  tech_preferences:
    frontend: Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind
    hosting: Cloud Run

  edge_cases:
  - 'Mobile/slow network: still readable; optimized images and fast initial render'
  - 'Chat assistant unavailable: show fallback message + email CTA'
  - 'Spam/abuse: contact form spam; prompt injection attempts; rate limiting'
  - 'JS disabled / GA blocked: site content still works; chatbot degrades gracefully'
  - '404/500: custom pages and safe navigation back home'
  - 'Chat logs retention/PII risk: avoid sensitive inputs; retention + deletion plan'
  success_metrics_v1:
  - 'Visitor can find: summary, GitHub, chatbot, and contact within 60 seconds'
  - 'Chatbot engagement: open + first message'
  - 'Contact intent: email clicks / form submissions'
  - Lighthouse >= 90 for Perf/A11y/Best/SEO
